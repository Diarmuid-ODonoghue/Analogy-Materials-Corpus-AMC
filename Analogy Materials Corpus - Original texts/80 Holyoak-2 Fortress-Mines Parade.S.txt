A small country was controlled by a dictator. The dictator ruled the
country from a strong fortress. The fortress was situated in the middle of
the country, surrounded by farms and villages. Many roads radiated outward
from the fortress like spokes on a wheel. To celebrate the anniversary
of his rise to power, the dictator ordered his general to conduct a
full-scale military parade. On the morning of the anniversary, the generalâ€™s
troops were gathered at the head of one of the roads leading to the
fortress, ready to march. However, a lieutenant brought the general a
disturbing report. The dictator was demanding that this parade had to be
more impressive than any previous parade. He wanted his army to be
seen and heard at the same time in every region of the country. Furthermore,
the dictator was threatening that if the parade was not sufficiently
impressive he was going to strip the general of his medals and reduce him
to the rank of private. But it seemed impossible to have a parade that
could be seen throughout the whole country.
 The general, however, knew just what to do. He divided his army up
into small groups and dispatched each group to the head of a different
road. When all was ready he gave the signal, and each group marched
down a different road. Each group continued down its road to the fortress,
so that the entire army finally arrived together at the fortress at the same
time. In this way, the general was able to have the parade seen and heard
through the entire country at once, and thus please the dictator.
