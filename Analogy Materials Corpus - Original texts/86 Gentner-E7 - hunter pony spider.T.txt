There once was a very jealous hunter who was friends with a pony. The hunter often said to the pony, "Don't ever-play with anyone else but me." 

One day the hunter went away on a trip and the pony had no one to play with. But then a spider came to visit the pony. He brought a wagon along and said, "Would you like to play with me and my wagon?". The pony said "Yes." The spider and the pony had a great time pulling each other around in the spider's wagon. 
When the hunter come back and found the pony playing with someone else he got very angry. He shouted, "I'll never play with you again!" The hunter was so angry that he jumped into the spider's wagon. But the wagon began to roll faster down a steep hill. The hunter was very scared. The spider jumped up and chased after the wagon so the hunter wouldn't crash. The spider stopped the runaway wagon and saved the hunter's life. 


In the end, the hunter realized that being jealous only got him into trouble. It is better to have two friends instead of one.
