There once was a very jealous giraffe who was friends with a turtle. The giraffe often said to the turtle, "Don't ever-play with anyone else but me." 

One day the giraffe went away on a trip and the turtle had no one to play with. But then a ostrich came to visit the turtle. He brought a wagon along and said, "Would you like to play with me and my wagon?". The turtle said "Yes." The ostrich and the turtle had a great time pulling each other around in the ostrich's wagon. 
When the giraffe come back and found the turtle playing with someone else he got very angry. He shouted, "I'll never play with you again!" The giraffe was so angry that he jumped into the ostrich's wagon. But the wagon began to roll faster down a steep hill. The giraffe was very scared. The ostrich jumped up and chased after the wagon so the giraffe wouldn't crash. The ostrich stopped the runaway wagon and saved the giraffe's life. 


In the end, the giraffe realized that being jealous only got him into trouble. It is better to have two friends instead of one.
