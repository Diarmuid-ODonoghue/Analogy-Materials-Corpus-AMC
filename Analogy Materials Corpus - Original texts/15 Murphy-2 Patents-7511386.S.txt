
US Patent 7511386: Air-blower tidal power generation device.
Abstract: An air-blower tidal power generation device
includes a rack, an air-blower mechanism, and a power
generation mechanism. The air-blower mechanism
includes a pumping device, a buoy, and an air conduit. The
pumping device includes a cylinder and a stationary barrel
movably coupled together. The power generation mechanism
includes a constant-pressure and pressure-regulation
device and a power generator having an air-driven turbine.
Thus, tides move the buoy up and down to drive the
pumping device for cyclically drawing and pumping air,
and the air is preserved in the constant-pressure and pressure-
regulation device to provide a constant pressure for
subsequent and stable supply of airflow to the turbine for
driving the power generator to generate power.
