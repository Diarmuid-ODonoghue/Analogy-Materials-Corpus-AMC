The computer science department at Gordmont is widely acknowledged to be one of the finest groups of its kind in the world. Recently, the department has begun to attract research funding from both federal granting agencies and private research foundations. Currently, the department is one of the best funded departments on campus. Despite the focus on research, the faculty have bonded together in a spirit of social activism. The members of the department often organize campus-wide events like a recycling-awareness day.
