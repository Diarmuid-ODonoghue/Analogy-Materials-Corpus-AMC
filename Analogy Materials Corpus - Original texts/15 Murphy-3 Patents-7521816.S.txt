Abstract: A water-powered motor for extracting raw
energy from a water current and converting it to kinetic
energy. The water-powered motor is generally rectangular
in shape with a generally round water wheel consisting of
foldable vanes. The vanes receive raw energy produced by
water current transforming that raw energy into usable
energy for powering a pump, electric generator, or as a
general power source to power other equipment such as
desalinization machinery.
