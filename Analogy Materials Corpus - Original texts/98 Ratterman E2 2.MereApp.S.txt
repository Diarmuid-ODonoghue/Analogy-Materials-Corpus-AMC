
New Mere-Appearance Match.
One day while Mr. Boyce was shaving, an employee burst into his office and told him a protective shield on one of their machines had broken. Unfortunately, this happened in the part of the factory that made sharp implements. As a result of the breakage several employees had nearly slashed themselves. Because workers were nervous, production slowed down a great deal. Therefore, Mr. Boyce called in one of his engineers. The engineer designed a better protective shield than had been on the machines before. Mr. Boyce hoped that installing the new shield would not result in factory down time.
