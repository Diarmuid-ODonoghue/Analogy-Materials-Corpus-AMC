
A woodsman and his wife were very poor and could not afford to feed
themselves and their two small children, Hansel and Gretel. As a solution,
the wife suggested that they lead the children out into the deep forest and
leave them there. So the next day they took them out to the forest to chop
wood. Hansel, with his pockets full of pebbles, dropped one at regular
intervals to mark a path back home. Later, while the children napped, the
parents returned home without them. That night, the children followed the
trail of pebbles that Hansel had left behind all the way home. When they
arrived home, the parents acted happy at their return but immediately
planned to take them back into the forest again the next day. Hansel, aware
of the plan, wanted to go outside that night to get more pebbles. However,
the wife locked both of the children in their room before he could do so.
The next morning, she gave both children a piece of bread for lunch.
Instead of saving the bread to eat, Hansel tore pieces off and left them on
the trail to mark the way home.
