There once was a very jealous vulture who was friends with a rhino. The vulture often said to the rhino, "Don't ever-play with anyone else but me." 

One day the vulture went away on a trip and the rhino had no one to play with. But then a bobcat came to visit the rhino. He brought a wagon along and said, "Would you like to play with me and my wagon?". The rhino said "Yes." The bobcat and the rhino had a great time pulling each other around in the bobcat's wagon. 
When the vulture come back and found the rhino playing with someone else he got very angry. He shouted, "I'll never play with you again!" The vulture was so angry that he jumped into the bobcat's wagon. But the wagon began to roll faster down a steep hill. The vulture was very scared. The bobcat jumped up and chased after the wagon so the vulture wouldn't crash. The bobcat stopped the runaway wagon and saved the vulture's life. 


In the end, the vulture realized that being jealous only got him into trouble. It is better to have two friends instead of one.
