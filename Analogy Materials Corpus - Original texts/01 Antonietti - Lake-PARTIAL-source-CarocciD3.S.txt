An engineer plans the construction of an artificial lake to produce electric energy. According to his first plan, a unique wide canal collects water coming from a valley and convey it into the lake. The total labor cost for the construction of such canal is $17,664. However, the engineer realizes that during the drought periods a unique stream of water may be insufficient to feed the lake. In order to avoid this mishap, the engineer elaborates a second plan. According to this plan, the lake is fed by four canals. These canals are placed around the lake so that they convey water coming from four different belts. In this way the lake is fed by water from various valleys, so that also during drought periods it is sufficiently fed. To implement the second plan 12 laborers have to work 8 hours daily for 23 days. Each laborer is paid $8 for each hour of work. The total labor of the second plan is cheaper, equal or more expansive than the labor of the first plan?
