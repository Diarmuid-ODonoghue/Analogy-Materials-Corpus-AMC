
Oscar the tiger had the greatest house in the best part of the forest. He believed that his luck was so good that a big storm would never come to the area that he lived in. A neighboring raccoon, Arnie, kept telling Oscar that his roof was broken in places and would never protect the rest of the house during storm season. However, Oscar was taken with himself, and tried to convince Arnie that nothing was wrong with his roof. One morning, a giant storm appeared in the distance. Oscar panicked and decided that Arnie was right. Oscar went off and got all of the materials he would need. By the time he was ready to start, the rain was coming down so hard that Oscar couldn't work anymore. Oscar's roof collapsed and the inside of his house was ruined.
