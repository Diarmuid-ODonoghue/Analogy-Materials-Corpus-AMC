There once was a very jealous gorilla who was friends with a steer. The gorilla often said to the steer, "Don't ever-play with anyone else but me." 

One day the gorilla went away on a trip and the steer had no one to play with. But then a alligator came to visit the steer. He brought a wagon along and said, "Would you like to play with me and my wagon?". The steer said "Yes." The alligator and the steer had a great time pulling each other around in the alligator's wagon. 
When the gorilla come back and found the steer playing with someone else he got very angry. He shouted, "I'll never play with you again!" The gorilla was so angry that he jumped into the alligator's wagon. But the wagon began to roll faster down a steep hill. The gorilla was very scared. The alligator jumped up and chased after the wagon so the gorilla wouldn't crash. The alligator stopped the runaway wagon and saved the gorilla's life. 


In the end, the gorilla realized that being jealous only got him into trouble. It is better to have two friends instead of one.
