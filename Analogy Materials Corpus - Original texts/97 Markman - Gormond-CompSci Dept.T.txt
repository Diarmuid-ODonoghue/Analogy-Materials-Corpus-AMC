The computer science department at Gordmont is widely acknowledged to be one of the
finest groups of its kind in the world. Over the last five years, the department has been
ranked number one among computer science departments in terms of the number of publications
by the faculty. This success has allowed the members of the faculty to secure a
number of large contracts that provide funds for the professors to carry out their research.
Unfortunately, the research reputation of this department is only outdone by the personal
reputations of the individual faculty. Almost all of the professors are known to be difficult
to get along with. Indeed, the individual members of the department seem to have little or
no respect for each other.
