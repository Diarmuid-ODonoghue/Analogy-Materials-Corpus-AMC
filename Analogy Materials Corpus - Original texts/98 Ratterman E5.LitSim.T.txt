Literally similar story.
Alfred was a young man from Sweden who was vacationing in Hawaii. He was annoyed at having to remain pale. He wanted to impress people with his dark tan.
So one day, Alfred spent the whole afternoon in the sun. He didn't realize what a risk being in the sun could be. As a result, by nightfall he had a terrible sunburn and needed medication. Alfred decided that Hawaii was not his style and decided to fly back to Sweden.
