Literally similar story.
"Mr. Boyce was director of manufacturing shaving knives for Gilette Company. In 1980 an engineer in his company perfected a steel alloy that would keep a finer edge than any previous blade. But later, when Mr. Boyce was using one of these new knives he slashed his throat pretty seriously. Because of this accident, the engineer recommended a new protective part that would prevent people from hurting themselves with the blade.
After this, Mr. Boyce considered the protective part absolutely necessary. The accident frightened him so much that he had the protective part developed immediately."
