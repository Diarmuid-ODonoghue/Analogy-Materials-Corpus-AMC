Once upon a time
there lived a magical genie. He was a very old,
wise, and rich genie indeed. One day while he was
polishing his home, which was actually a bottle, an
old friend came up. The genie told his friend, "I'm
going to look for a bigger and better home to live in.
Will you help me look?" So they began searching
far and wide for another bottle. Finally the genie
found the perfect home. It was larger, prettier, and
not too far away from his old bottle. The genie was
very excited and wanted to begin moving his belongings
right away. But now the genie had a problem.
He had a great many beautiful and very precious
jewels in his old home. He had to somehow
get all the jewels from his old bottle to the new
bottle without dropping or losing a single jewel.
	After thinking a bit, the genie came up with a
wonderful idea. He began searching for his magic
staff, or wand. He then commanded his staff to
stretch itself from his old home to his new home.
Next, the genie tugged and pulled on his magical
staff until at last he pulled the new bottle right up
next to his old bottle. At once, the genie began
gathering his jewels together in his old home and
simply dropped them carefully into his new home
right next to him. When all his jewels were safely
tucked away in his new home, the genie settled in
happily. He invited his friend to come in and admire
his new home. His friend came in and said,
"What a good house for you!" I'm sure you can still
find the genie sitting in his new bigger and better
bottle with all his jewels and smiling contentedly
even today!
