There once was a very jealous cowboy who was friends with a zebra. The cowboy often said to the zebra, "Don't ever-play with anyone else but me." 

One day the cowboy went away on a trip and the zebra had no one to play with. But then a fly came to visit the zebra. He brought a wagon along and said, "Would you like to play with me and my wagon?". The zebra said "Yes." The fly and the zebra had a great time pulling each other around in the fly's wagon. 
When the cowboy come back and found the zebra playing with someone else he got very angry. He shouted, "I'll never play with you again!" The cowboy was so angry that he jumped into the fly's wagon. But the wagon began to roll faster down a steep hill. The cowboy was very scared. The fly jumped up and chased after the wagon so the cowboy wouldn't crash. The fly stopped the runaway wagon and saved the cowboy's life. 


In the end, the cowboy realized that being jealous only got him into trouble. It is better to have two friends instead of one.
