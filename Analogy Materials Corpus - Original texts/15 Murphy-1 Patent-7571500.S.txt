US Patent 7571500: Inflating/deflating device for an inflatable air mattress.
Abstract: An inflating/deflating device includes a fan
unit disposed inside a main housing. A release valve
assembly is connected to a deflating port of the main
housing for fluid communication with a first air passage of
the fan unit. An inlet valve assembly is connected to an
inflating port of the main housing for fluid communication
with a second air passage of the fan unit. A control unit is
provided to control the release and inlet valve assemblies.
The control unit is operable to switch a first or a second
actuating position. The control unit actuates the fan unit
and the inlet valve assembly to perform an inflating mode
in the first actuating position, and actuates the fan unit and
the release valve assembly to perform a deflating mode in
the second actuating position.
