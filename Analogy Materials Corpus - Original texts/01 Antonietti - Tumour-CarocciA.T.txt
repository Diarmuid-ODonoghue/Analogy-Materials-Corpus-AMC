In a university lab a very expensive light bulb which would emit precisely controlled quantities of light was being used in some experiments. One morning the research assistant responsible for operating the sensitive light bulb came into the lab and found to her dismay that the light bulb no longer worked. She realized that she had forgotten to turn it off the previous night. As a result the light bulb overheated, and the filament inside the bulb had broken into two parts. The surrounding glass bulb was completely sealed, so there was no way to open it. The light bulb could be repaired if a brief, high intensity laser ray could be used to fuse the two parts of the filament into one. Furthermore, the lab had the necessary equipment to do the job. However, a high intensity laser ray it also break the fragile glass surrounding the filament. At lower intensity the laser ray would not break the glass, but neither would it fuse the filament. So it seemed that the light bulb could not be repaired. How could you solve this situation?
