
Close Cue: After several confrontations with the publisher of
the magazine, Denise Benson, Evan sent his portfolio around.
Denise thought that Evan was the best graphic designer they
employed. Evan decided to work at a competing magazine.
However, the competing magazine never rewarded good workers
because it didn't believe in giving bonuses. Denise immediately
proposed giving Evan a substantial raise when she realized
what was occurring. Around then, he was wondering if she
would welcome him back.
