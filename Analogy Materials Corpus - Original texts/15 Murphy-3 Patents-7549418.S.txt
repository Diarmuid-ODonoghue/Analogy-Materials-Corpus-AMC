Abstract: A heat generation and storage device supplements
building heating and hot water systems. A roof cap
including an air passage is connected to air outlets disposed
within the roof structure of a building and to air passages
formed by panels mounted over the surface of a building’s
roof. The roof cap is connected to a vent which either
exhausts air to the atmosphere and/or recirculates air to a
liquid heat storage tank. Heated air and heated water from
the storage tank supplement a building’s heating and hot
water systems.
