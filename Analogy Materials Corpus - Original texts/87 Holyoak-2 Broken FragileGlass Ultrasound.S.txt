
In a physics lab at a major university, a very expensive lightbulb which would emit precisely controlled quantities of light was being used in some experiments. Ruth was the research assistant responsible for operating the sensitive lightbulb. One morning she came into the lab and found to her dismay that the lightbulb no longer worked. She realized that she had forgotten to turn it off the previous night. As a result the lightbulb overheated, and the filament inside the bulb had broken into two parts. The surrounding glass bulb was completely sealed, so there was no way to open it. 
	Ruth knew that the lightbulb could be repaired if a brief, high-intensity laser beam could be used to fuse the two parts of the filament into one. Furthermore, the lab had the necessary equipment to do the job.


However, the ultrasound machines only generated
low-intensity waves that were not strong enough to 
jar apart the fused parts. She needed a much more
intense ultrasound wave]. So it seemed that the lightbulb
could not be repaired, and a costly replacement would be
required.
Ruth was about to give up when she had an idea. She placed
several ultrasound machines in a circle around the lightbulb,
and administered low-intensity ultrasound
waves from several directions all at once. The waves
all converged on the filament, where their combined effect was
enough to jar apart the fused parts. Ruth was greatly
relieved that the lightbulb was repaired, and she then went on
to successfully complete the experiment.
