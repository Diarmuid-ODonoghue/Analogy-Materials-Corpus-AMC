Two bowls are on a table, one within the child's reach and one farther away. One bowl contains a number of small gumballs, and the other is empty. Also on the table is an aluminum walking cane, a large rectangular sheet of heavy paper (posterboard), a hollow cardboard tube long enough to reach the farther bowl, child-safe scissors, string, tape, paper clips, and rubber bands. The task is to use the materials provided, to transfer the balls from the filled bowl to the empty bowl without leaving their seat.
