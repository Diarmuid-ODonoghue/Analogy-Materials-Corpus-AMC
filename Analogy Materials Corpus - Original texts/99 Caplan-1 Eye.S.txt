Eye Source Passage. 
The eye is the basic organ for vision. It works in the following way. The part of the
eye that ultimately receives the image of objects in the environment is called the retina.
The retina is located at the back of the eye. It has two kinds of receptors. The
chemicals in the receptors undergo areaction when light hits them. The two types of
receptors are used under different lighting conditions. Cones are the receptors that
work best in bright light. Because cones work relatively individually, and because
they are packed closely together on the retina, they record most of the detail in the
image that is sent to the retina. Rods are the other kind of receptor; they work best
under relatively dim lighting conditions. Because rods work in clumps, which are
more spread out on the retina, they do not record as much of the detail of the image.
How does the image of the outside world get to the retina? First, light is reflected
off objects in the world, and enters the eye through the pupil. The pupil is
surrounded by the iris, a muscle that controls the size of the pupil. When the iris
makes the pupil small, relatively little light enters the eye. When it makes the pupil
large, more light enters. Light that has entered through the pupil next goes through
the lens. The lens focuses the image on the retina. Because of the way the lens
works, it turns the image upside-down before it hits the retina. When a lens is, in
effect, thick, it focuses objects that are relatively close to the person. When it is, in
effect, thin, it focuses objects that are farther away.
To focus the eye, the muscles surrounding a lens respond to the conditions on
the retina. The image, which has passed through the lens, hits the retina. If the image
is focused properly, it is sharp on the retina. If it is not, it is blurred on the retina,
and the muscles surrounding the lens adjust until the image is sharp.
