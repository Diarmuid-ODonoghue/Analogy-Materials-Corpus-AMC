Appendix theme 1.
Phil was in love with his secretary. However, he was
afraid of responsibility, so he kept dating others and made up
excuses to postpone the wedding. Finally, his secretary got fed
up, began dating, and fell in love with a doctor. When Phil
found out, he went to her and proposed marriage, showing her
the ring he had bought. His secretary was already planning her
honeymoon with the doctor by that time.
