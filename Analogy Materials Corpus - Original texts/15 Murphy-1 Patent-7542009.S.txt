Abstract: A wireless communication device using a
single spiral inductor antenna and a signal receiving/
transmitting method thereof operated on multi-band is
provided. The single spiral inductor antenna is designed to
have a plurality of different inductance paths. Different
inductance values are inducted with signal paths switched
by a plurality of switches so as to meet the requirements of
multi-band operation. As the circuit structure of the single
spiral inductor antenna is used, the circuit area is reduced
effectively.
