There once was a very jealous cow who was friends with a camel. The cow often said to the camel, "Don't ever-play with anyone else but me." 

One day the cow went away on a trip and the camel had no one to play with. But then a cricket came to visit the camel. He brought a wagon along and said, "Would you like to play with me and my wagon?". The camel said "Yes." The cricket and the camel had a great time pulling each other around in the cricket's wagon. 
When the cow come back and found the camel playing with someone else he got very angry. He shouted, "I'll never play with you again!" The cow was so angry that he jumped into the cricket's wagon. But the wagon began to roll faster down a steep hill. The cow was very scared. The cricket jumped up and chased after the wagon so the cow wouldn't crash. The cricket stopped the runaway wagon and saved the cow's life. 


In the end, the cow realized that being jealous only got him into trouble. It is better to have two friends instead of one.
