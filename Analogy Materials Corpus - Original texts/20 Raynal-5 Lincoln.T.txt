
Two weak nations, Lincoln and Moreland, bordered each other.
Both countries relied heavily on the tourist trade to keep their
economies afloat. They competed with each other over which
one of them would get the most tourists. Meanwhile, another
nearby nation, Chad, had a very strong economy with a
thriving tourist trade. Tourist cruises flocked into its harbors
and planes full of visitors were constantly landing in its airport.
Because of this, Moreland tried to join forces with Chad in its
new advertising campaign to entice still more tourists.
Unfortunately a hurricane hit the coast and bankrupted all three
nations.
