Close Cue.
Lisa spent long hours trying to make her corporation successful. She was very sure about herself. Lisa had broken up with her
fiance a year ago. She wanted to meet someone new. A co-worker set her up to go out with someone he knew well. She waited at the fancy restaurant until 8:30 and then left without ordering dinner. She told her friend that she thought that her date probably wasn't that handsome and that investment bankers are really boring, anyway.
