
There once was a very strong fly who was friends with a cowboy. 

One day the fly went away on a trip and the cowboy had no one to play with. But then a zebra came to visit the cowboy. He brought a wagon along and said, "Would you like to play with me and my wagon?". The cowboy said "Yes." The zebra and the cowboy had a great time pulling each other around in the zebra's wagon. 
When the fly come back and found the cowboy playing with someone else he got very angry. He shouted, "I'll never play with you again!" The fly was so angry that he jumped into the zebra's wagon. But the wagon began to roll faster down a steep hill. The fly was very scared. The zebra jumped up and chased after the wagon so the fly wouldn't crash. The zebra stopped the runaway wagon and saved the fly's life.
