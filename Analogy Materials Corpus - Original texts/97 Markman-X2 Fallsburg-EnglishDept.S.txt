Many of the faculty in the English department got their degrees in the 1960s. This era
has clearly left its mark on the faculty. They are vocal proponents of environmental causes,
and they often encourage their students to speak out on these issues. Because of their wellknown
stance as activists, many members of the faculty have been called to testify before
Congress. As a result, many members of this department have become recognizable faces
on television news programs.
   The English department faculty also have excellent reputations as teachers. Not only are
the faculty in this department extremely bright, they are able to enter the "beginner's mind"
and present material in a clear engaging manner. Because of this teaching skill, the English
faculty have developed a rather smug attitude, and often look down on members of other
departments. As a result, the members of the English department are resented by many faculty
from other departments.
