The degree of animosity between members of the faculty in Anthropology is obvious to
anyone who looks at the department. This has not gone unnoticed at other Universities,
where it has been viewed as a potential opportunity, and at least once per semester, a faculty
member in the department is offered another job at a prestigious University. The offers
from outside schools has led a number of faculty members to leave in recent years.
   Because of their work with people with people from other cultures, the Anthropology
faculty tend to be politically active. In particular, the faculty in this department are on the
boards of many charities. In their classes, they organize fund-raising drives for multi-cultural
causes. This activity has fostered a spirit of giving at the University, and has led to a
strong community involvement among students.
