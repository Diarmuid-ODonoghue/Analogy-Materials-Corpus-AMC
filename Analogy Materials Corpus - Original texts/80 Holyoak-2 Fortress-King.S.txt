 A small country was ruled [from a strong fortress] by a king. 
The fortress was situated in the middle of the country surrounded by
farms and villages. Many roads radiated outward from the fortress 
like spokes on a wheel. A rebel general vowed to capture the
fortress. The general knew that an attack [by his entire army]
would capture the fortress. He gathered his army at the head of
one of the roads. However, the general learned that the king had
planted mines on each of the roads. The mines were set so
that [small] bodies of men could pass over them safely, since the
king needed to move his troops and workers to and from the fortress.
 However, any [large] force would detonate the mines. Not
only would this blow up the road and render it impassable, but it
would also destroy many neighboring villages. It therefore seemed
impossible to mount a [full-scale direct] attack on the fortress.
 The general, however, knew just what to do. He divided his army
up into small groups and dispatched each group to the head of a
different road. When all was ready he gave the signal and
each group marched down a different road. Each group continued
down its road to the fortress so that the [entire] army finally
arrived [together] at the fortress at the same time. The fortress
fell and the king was forced to flee into exile.
