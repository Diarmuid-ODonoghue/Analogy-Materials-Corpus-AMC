A small country was controlled by a dictator. The dictator ruled the
country from a strong fortress. The fortress was situated in the middle of
the country, surrounded by farms and villages. Many roads radiated outward
from the fortress like spokes on a wheel. A general arose who raised
a large army and vowed to capture the fortress and free the country of the
dictator. The general knew that if his entire army could attack the fortress
at once it could be captured. The generalâ€™s troops were gathered at the
head of one of the roads leading to the fortress, ready to attack. However,
a spy brought the general a disturbing report. The ruthless dictator had
planted mines on each of the roads. The mines were set so that small
bodies of men could pass over them safely, since the dictator needed to be
able to move troops and workers to and from the fortress. However, any
large force would detonate the mines. Not only would this blow up the
road and render it impassable, but the dictator would then destroy many
villages in retaliation. It therefore seemed impossible to mount a full-scale
direct attack on the fortress.
The general, however, knew just what to do. He divided his army up
into small groups and dispatched each group to the head of a different
road. When all was ready he gave the signal, and each group marched
down a different road. Each group continued down its road to the fortress,
so that the entire army finally arrived together at the fortress at the same
time. In this way, the general was able to capture the fortress, and thus
overthrow the dictator.
