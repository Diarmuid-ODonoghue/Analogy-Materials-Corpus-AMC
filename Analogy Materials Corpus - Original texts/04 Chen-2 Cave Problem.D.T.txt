
A treasure hunter is going to explore a cave up on a hill near a beach. He
suspected there might be many paths inside the cave so he was afraid that
he might get lost. Obviously, he did not have a map of the cave; all that he
had with him were some common items such as a flashlight and a bag.
What could he do to make sure he did not get lost trying to get back out of
the cave later?
