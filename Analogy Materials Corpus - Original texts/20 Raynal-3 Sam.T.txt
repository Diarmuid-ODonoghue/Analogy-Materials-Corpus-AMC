
A magpie named Sam sang all summer. When winter came he
paid a visit to a chipmunk. However, the chipmunk was not at
all pleased with Sam.
"You have wasted the summer while I have been hard at
work!" she said. Sam performed a ballad for her hoping she
would give him some nuts in return. But she was still not
pleased. "I will not give you any of my nuts!" she exclaimed.
