New Mere-Appearance Match.
Alfred was a young man with a Swedish last mane. Alfred lived in the Bahamas and had very dark skin because he spent a great deal of time in the sun.
Alfred had a job in a medical clinic and constantly saw people who had overdone it and gotten terrible sunburns. They were always embarrassed about being so silly. But Alfred never had any problems. In fact he would spend whole weekends sunning himself on a big pleasure cruiser.
