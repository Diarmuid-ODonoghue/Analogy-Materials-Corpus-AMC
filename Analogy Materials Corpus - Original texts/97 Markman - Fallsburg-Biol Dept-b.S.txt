The biology department at Fallsburg teaches many of the pre-medical courses for the students, and also prides itself on maintaining an active research program. Over the last few years, a number of the older faculty have taken advantage of an early retirement program offered by the state, and, three younger faculty were lured to another school with offers of higher salaries. These departures have left the Biology department with fewer faculty than they would like to have. Because there are fewer faculty than are needed in this department, it has been difficult for them to carry out all of the administrative work that needs to be done. There are not enough faculty to organize meetings for faculty business and to advise majors in biology.
	Many of the faculty in the biology department got their degrees in the 1960s. This era has clearly left its mark on the faculty. They are vocal proponents of environmental causes, and they often encourage their students to speak out on these issues. Because of their wellknown stance as activists, many members of the faculty have been called to testify before Congress.
