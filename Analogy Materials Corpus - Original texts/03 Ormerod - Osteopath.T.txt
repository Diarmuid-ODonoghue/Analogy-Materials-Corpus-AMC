After many years of research, a Philadelphia doctor of Osteopathy thinks that he has found a way to alleviate chronic back pain. The doctor theorizes that if a high velocity thrust can be applied to a fairly wide section of the lumber region of a person's back they will be cured. Unfortunately, the doctor has found it impossible to test his theory because he is unable to deliver a high velocity thrust of sufficient force because such a thrust requires more strength than the doctor possesses. The suggestion is to have the doctor develop a machine that is capable of delivering the high velocity thrust.
