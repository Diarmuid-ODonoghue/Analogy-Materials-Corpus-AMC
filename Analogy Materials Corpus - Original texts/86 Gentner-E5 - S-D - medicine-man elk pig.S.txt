There once was a very jealous medicine-man who was friends with a elk. The medicine-man often said to the elk, "Don't ever-play with anyone else but me." 

One day the medicine-man went away on a trip and the elk had no one to play with. But then a pig came to visit the elk. He brought a wagon along and said, "Would you like to play with me and my wagon?". The elk said "Yes." The pig and the elk had a great time pulling each other around in the pig's wagon. 
When the medicine-man come back and found the elk playing with someone else he got very angry. He shouted, "I'll never play with you again!" The medicine-man was so angry that he jumped into the pig's wagon. But the wagon began to roll faster down a steep hill. The medicine-man was very scared. The pig jumped up and chased after the wagon so the medicine-man wouldn't crash. The pig stopped the runaway wagon and saved the medicine-man's life. 


In the end, the medicine-man realized that being jealous only got him into trouble. It is better to have two friends instead of one.
