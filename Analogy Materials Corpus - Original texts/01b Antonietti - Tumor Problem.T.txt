A doctor is faced with a patient who has a malignant tumor in his stomach.
It is impossible to operate on the patient, but-unless the tumor is destroyed
the patient will die.
X-rays can be used to destroy the tumor. If an x-ray reaches it at a sufficiently
hlgh intensity, the tumor will be destroyed.
Unfortunately at this intensity the healthy tissue through which the ray
passes on the way to the tumor will also be destroyed. At lower intensities
the ray is harmless to healthy tissue but it will not affect the tumor either.
What type of procedure might be used to destroy the tumor with the
x-rays and at the same time avoid destroying the healthy tissue?
