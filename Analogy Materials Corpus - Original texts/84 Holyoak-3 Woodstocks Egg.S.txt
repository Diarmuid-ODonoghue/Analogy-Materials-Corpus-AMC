Woodstock had built a nest on top of Snoopy's doghouse. She had put her eggs in it and was waiting for them to hatch and the baby birds to come out. But Snoopy was unhappy about all this. The nest was in the way when he tried to lie down. And Snoopy was afraid that when the baby birds arrived, they would make so much noise with their chirping that he wouldn't be able to sleep at all! 	

 Woodstock didn't want to get Snoopy upset, and so she agreed that the eggs would have to be moved. So she built a new nest in a tree a little ways from Snoopy's house. But now there was one prob- lem, and a very serious one. How would they move the eggs safely from Snoopy's rooftop to the new nest in the tree? Snoopy and Woodstock were both afraid that the eggs would get broken if they tried to carry them down from the roof and up the tree. 

 They both thought and thought. Then Snoopy had a great idea. While Woodstock hovered in the air watching, Snoopy took a blanket and rolled it up. Then he tossed it across so that it hooked on a branch of the tree. The rolled blanket stretched right across to the new nest. Then Snoopy carefully rolled the eggs one by one through the rolled blanket into the nest in the tree. All the eggs were soon moved safely. Woodstock liked her new tree nest, and Snoopy was finally able to sleep comfortably again on his rooftop.
