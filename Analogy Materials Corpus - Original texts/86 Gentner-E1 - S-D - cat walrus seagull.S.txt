There once was a very jealous cat who was friends with a walrus. The cat often said to the walrus, "Don't ever-play with anyone else but me." 

One day the cat went away on a trip and the walrus had no one to play with. But then a seagull came to visit the walrus. He brought a wagon along and said, "Would you like to play with me and my wagon?". The walrus said "Yes." The seagull and the walrus had a great time pulling each other around in the seagull's wagon. 
When the cat come back and found the walrus playing with someone else he got very angry. He shouted, "I'll never play with you again!" The cat was so angry that he jumped into the seagull's wagon. But the wagon began to roll faster down a steep hill. The cat was very scared. The seagull jumped up and chased after the wagon so the cat wouldn't crash. The seagull stopped the runaway wagon and saved the cat's life. 


In the end, the cat realized that being jealous only got him into trouble. It is better to have two friends instead of one.
