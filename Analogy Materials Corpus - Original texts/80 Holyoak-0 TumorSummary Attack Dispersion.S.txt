A fortress was located in the center of the country.
Many roads radiated out from the fortress.
A general wanted to capture the fortress with his army.
The general wanted to prevent mines on the roads from destroying his
army and neighboring villages.
As a result the entire army could not attack the fortress along one road.
However, the entire army was needed to capture the fortress.
So an attack by one small group would not succeed.
The general therefore divided his army into several small groups.
He positioned the small groups at the heads of different roads.
The small groups simultaneously converged on the fortress.
In this way the army captured the fortress.
