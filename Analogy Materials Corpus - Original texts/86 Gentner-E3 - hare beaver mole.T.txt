There once was a very jealous hare who was friends with a beaver. The hare often said to the beaver, "Don't ever-play with anyone else but me." 

One day the hare went away on a trip and the beaver had no one to play with. But then a mole came to visit the beaver. He brought a wagon along and said, "Would you like to play with me and my wagon?". The beaver said "Yes." The mole and the beaver had a great time pulling each other around in the mole's wagon. 
When the hare come back and found the beaver playing with someone else he got very angry. He shouted, "I'll never play with you again!" The hare was so angry that he jumped into the mole's wagon. But the wagon began to roll faster down a steep hill. The hare was very scared. The mole jumped up and chased after the wagon so the hare wouldn't crash. The mole stopped the runaway wagon and saved the hare's life. 


In the end, the hare realized that being jealous only got him into trouble. It is better to have two friends instead of one.
