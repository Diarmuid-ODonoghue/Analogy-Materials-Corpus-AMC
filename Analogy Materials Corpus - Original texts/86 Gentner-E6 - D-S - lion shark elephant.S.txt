There once was a very jealous lion who was friends with a shark. The lion often said to the shark, "Don't ever-play with anyone else but me." 

One day the lion went away on a trip and the shark had no one to play with. But then a elephant came to visit the shark. He brought a wagon along and said, "Would you like to play with me and my wagon?". The shark said "Yes." The elephant and the shark had a great time pulling each other around in the elephant's wagon. 
When the lion come back and found the shark playing with someone else he got very angry. He shouted, "I'll never play with you again!" The lion was so angry that he jumped into the elephant's wagon. But the wagon began to roll faster down a steep hill. The lion was very scared. The elephant jumped up and chased after the wagon so the lion wouldn't crash. The elephant stopped the runaway wagon and saved the lion's life. 


In the end, the lion realized that being jealous only got him into trouble. It is better to have two friends instead of one.
