Ruth was the research assistant responsible for operating the sensitive lightbulb. One morning she came into the lab and found to her dismay that the lightbulb no longer worked. She realized that she had forgotten to tum it off the previous night. As a result the lightbulb overheated,
and two wires in the filament inside the bulb fused together. The surrounding glass bulb was completely sealed, so there was no way to open it. Ruth knew that the lightbulb could be repaired if a brief, high-intensity ultrasound wave could be used to jar apart the fused parts. Furthermore, the lab had the necessary equipment to do the job.


However, a high-intensity ultrasound wave would also break the fragile glass surrounding the filament. At lower intensities the ultrasound wave would not break the glass, but neither would it jar apart the fused parts. So it seemed that the lightbulb could not be repaired, and a costly replacement would be required.
Ruth was about to give up when she had an idea. She placed several ultrasound machines in a circle around the lightbulb, and administered low-intensity ultrasound waves from several directions all at once. The waves all converged on the filament, where their combined effect was enough to jar apart the fused parts. Since each spot on the surrounding glass received only a low-intensity wave from one ultrasound machine, the glass was left intact. Ruth was greatly relieved that the lightbulb was repaired, and she then went on to successfully complete the experiment.
