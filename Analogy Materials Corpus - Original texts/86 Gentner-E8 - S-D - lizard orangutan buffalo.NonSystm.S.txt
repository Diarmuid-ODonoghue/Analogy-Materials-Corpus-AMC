
There once was a very strong lizard who was friends with a orangutan. 

One day the lizard went away on a trip and the orangutan had no one to play with. But then a buffalo came to visit the orangutan. He brought a wagon along and said, "Would you like to play with me and my wagon?". The orangutan said "Yes." The buffalo and the orangutan had a great time pulling each other around in the buffalo's wagon. 
When the lizard come back and found the orangutan playing with someone else he got very angry. He shouted, "I'll never play with you again!" The lizard was so angry that he jumped into the buffalo's wagon. But the wagon began to roll faster down a steep hill. The lizard was very scared. The buffalo jumped up and chased after the wagon so the lizard wouldn't crash. The buffalo stopped the runaway wagon and saved the lizard's life.
