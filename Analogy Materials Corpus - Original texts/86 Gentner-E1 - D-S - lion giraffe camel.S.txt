There once was a very jealous lion who was friends with a giraffe. The lion often said to the giraffe, "Don't ever-play with anyone else but me." 

One day the lion went away on a trip and the giraffe had no one to play with. But then a camel came to visit the giraffe. He brought a wagon along and said, "Would you like to play with me and my wagon?". The giraffe said "Yes." The camel and the giraffe had a great time pulling each other around in the camel's wagon. 
When the lion come back and found the giraffe playing with someone else he got very angry. He shouted, "I'll never play with you again!" The lion was so angry that he jumped into the camel's wagon. But the wagon began to roll faster down a steep hill. The lion was very scared. The camel jumped up and chased after the wagon so the lion wouldn't crash. The camel stopped the runaway wagon and saved the lion's life. 

In the end, the lion realized that being jealous only got him into trouble. It is better to have two friends instead of one.
