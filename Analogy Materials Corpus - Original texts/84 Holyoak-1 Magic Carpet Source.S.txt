Once upon a time there lived a magical genie. He was a very old, wise, and rich genie indeed. One day while he was polishing his home, which was actually a bottle, he decided he would like to find an even bigger and better home to live in. So he began searching far and wide for another bottle. Finally he found the perfect home. It was larger, prettier, and not too far away from his old bottle. The genie was very excited and began moving his belongings right away. But now the genie had a problem. He had a great many beautiful and very precious jewels in his old home. He had to somehow get all the jewels from his old bottle to the new bottle without dropping or losing a single jewel. After thinking a bit, the genie came up with a wonderful idea. 

 He searched for his magic carpet. Then he commanded it to roll itself up into a long hollow tube. Next the genie commanded his flying carpet to place one end at his old home and the other end at his new home so that it formed a sort of hollow bridge between the two bottles. Then, the genie very carefully took one jewel from inside his old home and placed it into the opening of his carpet. At once, the jewel began tumbling and rolling through the carpet tube until it reached his new home and plopped safely inside. The genie grinned happily and began rolling all his jewels through the carpet into his new home. In fact, I'm sure you can still find him sitting in his new, bigger and better bottle with all his jewels and smiling contentedly even today!
