Ernie was really encouraged about his interview for a security guard at the new factory in town. He thought he was saved. Ernie went to the shopping mall and hunted around for a dark blue security guard uniform, and bought several. The next day he received a phone call from the factory personnel director about the security guard position. Ernie  was dismayed  that  he  had  wasted  money.  He didn't  have a job.
