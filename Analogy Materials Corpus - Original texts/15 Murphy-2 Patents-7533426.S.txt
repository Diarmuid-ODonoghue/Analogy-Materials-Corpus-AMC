Abstract: Embodiments of the present invention provide
systems and methods for a gray water interface valve for
use with a vacuum source and a collection tank. The systems
and methods comprise a basin for collecting gray
water, the basin having an outlet; a reservoir in fluid
communication with the outlet, the reservoir adapted to
house gray water; a vent line associated with the reservoir;
a pressure switch associated with the reservoir, the pressure
switch adapted to signal when the reservoir is full; a controller
associated with the pressure switch, the controller
adapted to begin a discharge cycle by checking and
switching on the vacuum source if necessary; a solenoid
valve activated by the controller in order to control the flow
of vacuum through the system; and a drain valve adapted to
open via vacuum pressure and evacuate gray water from
the reservoir, wherein the drain valve is adapted to close
before all of the gray water from the reservoir is emptied to
reduce noise.
