None of them were sure, but they thought that perhaps the rock was an asteroid that had fallen down from outer space thousands of years ago. To gather relevant information about the asteroid, the team needed to measure its size and weight. The tape measure that they had allowed them to measure the asteroidâ€™s height and length. However, the scale that they had brought could only measure up to 300 pounds of weight. Thus, the scale was obviously too small to weigh the asteroid. They looked around in a nearby village to see what resources they had to weigh the asteroid. How could they solve the problem?
