
Once there was a hawk named Karla. She saw a sportsman armed with a longbow coming after her. Karla noticed that some of the arrows had no feathers. She thought that she might be able to strike a deal. Karla flew down and donated a few of her tail feathers to the sportsman. The sportsman promised never to attack hawks again. One day she was nesting on a rocky cliffwhen the sportsman shot at her. The arrows now had her tail feathers on them.
