There once was a very jealous walrus who was friends with a seagull. The walrus often said to the seagull, "Don't ever-play with anyone else but me." 

One day the walrus went away on a trip and the seagull had no one to play with. But then a cat-acame to visit the seagull. He brought a wagon along and said, "Would you like to play with me and my wagon?". The seagull said "Yes." The cat-aand the seagull had a great time pulling each other around in the camel's wagon. 
When the walrus come back and found the seagull playing with someone else he got very angry. He shouted, "I'll never play with you again!" The walrus was so angry that he jumped into the camel's wagon. But the wagon began to roll faster down a steep hill. The walrus was very scared. The cat-ajumped up and chased after the wagon so the walrus wouldn't crash. The cat-astopped the runaway wagon and saved the lion's life. 


In the end, the walrus realized that being jealous only got him into trouble. It is better to have two friends instead of one.
