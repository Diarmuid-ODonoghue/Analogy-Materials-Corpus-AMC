
Two cords were attached to the ceiling of a lab and you must come up with ways to tie the two ends together. The two cords were placed just far enough apart that, while holding on to one cord, you couldn’t reach the other cord. Some objects were placed around the room – such as extension cords, poles, clamps, and weights – and these could be used to help them solve the puzzle.


To solve the problem attach a weight to one of the cords and set it swinging. Then grab the other rope and can reach the swinging rope when it comes towards you.
