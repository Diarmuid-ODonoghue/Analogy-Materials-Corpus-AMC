A small country fell under the iron rule of a dictator. The dictator ruled
the country from a strong fortress. The fortress was situated in the middle
of the country, surrounded by farms and villages. Many roads radiated
outward from the fortress like spokes on a wheel. A great general arose
who raised a large army at the border and vowed to capture the fortress
and free the country of the dictator. The general knew that if his entire
army could attack the fortress at once it could be captured. His troops
were poised at the head of one of the roads leading to the fortress, ready
to attack. However, a spy brought the general a disturbing report. The
ruthless dictator had planted mines on each of the roads. The mines were
set so that small bodies of men could pass over them safely, since the
dictator needed to be able to move troops and workers to and from the
fortress. However, any large force would detonate the mines. Not only
would this blow up the road and render it impassable, but the dictator
would then destroy many villages in retaliation. A full-scale direct attack
on the fortress therefore appeared impossible. 

The general, however, was undaunted. He and his men dug an underground
tunnel beneath the mines following the route of the road to the
fortress. When the tunnel was dug, the men crawled through it until they
arrived safely at the foot of the fortress. Here they all gathered together
and attacked the fortress in full strength. In this way, the general was able
to capture the fortress and overthrow the dictator.
