
A general was trying to destroy an intercontinental ballistic missile, using a type of ray, which would be entering the atmosphere at great speeds. He needed to use a high-intensity ray in order to destroy the incoming missile. However, such high-intensity rays were inaccurate because they would heat up the air through which they passed, thus distorting the beam.
After considerable thought, he knew what to do. He divided the high-intensity rays into a number of low-intensity rays and, by sending these low-intensity rays, simultaneously, from a number of different directions, they converged on the missile making up a sufficiently powerful beam to destroy it.
