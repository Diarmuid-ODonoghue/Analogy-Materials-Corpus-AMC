There once was a very jealous camel who was friends with a giraffe. The camel often said to the giraffe, "Don't ever-play with anyone else but me." 

One day the camel went away on a trip and the giraffe had no one to play with. But then a lion came to visit the giraffe. He brought a wagon along and said, "Would you like to play with me and my wagon?". The giraffe said "Yes." The lion and the giraffe had a great time pulling each other around in the lion's wagon. 
When the camel come back and found the giraffe playing with someone else he got very angry. He shouted, "I'll never play with you again!" The camel was so angry that he jumped into the lion's wagon. But the wagon began to roll faster down a steep hill. The camel was very scared. The lion jumped up and chased after the wagon so the camel wouldn't crash. The lion stopped the runaway wagon and saved the camel's life. 


In the end, the camel realized that being jealous only got him into trouble. It is better to have two friends instead of one.
