
In a village by a river, the chief of a tribe had the responsibility of taking
care of the tribe’s sacred stone statue. It was the chief’s custom every year
to go down river to the next village to collect taxes. To assess the amount
of taxes, the chief would ask for the statue’s weight in gold coins. His
method of measuring this amount was to put the statue in a large tub at one
end of a hanging balance scale and hook the other end of the scale to
another large tub. This second tub was filled with gold coins until the scale
balanced the weight of the statue. During a recent trip to collect taxes, the
chief forgot to bring his balance scale. Now the chief has a problem: How
can he figure out how much gold to take to match the statue’s weight
without the benefit of a balance scale, a pulley system, or a conventional
scale?
