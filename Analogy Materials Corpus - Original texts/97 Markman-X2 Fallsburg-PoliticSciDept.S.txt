The faculty in the Political Science department have strenuously and successfully pursued
research grants to allow them to conduct their research. As a result, this department
has more money for the pursuit of research than any other department at the University.
This funding has allowed the faculty to hire research assistants for all of the faculty members.
Because every faculty member has a research assistant, the faculty have had enough
time to maintain high-level research careers without sacrificing the quality of their teaching.
	The Political Science department at Fallsburg is one of the largest departments at the
University. The undergraduate students have consistently rated the faculty in this department
as the best teachers on campus. Their reputation as fine teachers has spread throughout
the campus so that almost every student wants to take at least one Political Science
course during their studies. This popularity has caused most of the Political Science
courses to be oversubscribed. Students must often wait over a year to get into the course of
their choice.
