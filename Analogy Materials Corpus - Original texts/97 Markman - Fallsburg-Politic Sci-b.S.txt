The Political Science department has an odd mix of faculty. About half of the professors
have a strong interest in the role of Socialist and Marxist ideology in world government.
The other half of the faculty study the emergence of democratic republics, particularly in
Third World nations. Despite these radically different orientations, most of the professors
are quite open-minded. In fact, the department recently organized a conference at which
both groups gave talks about their findings. The conference was quite well received, and a
favorable story about the meeting appeared in The Washington Post.
   The faculty in Political Science are quite active researchers, and almost all of them have
research grants from large government agencies. These grants provide the department with
money to hire personnel. Because of the large number of grants, the department has been
able to hire research assistants for every faculty member.
