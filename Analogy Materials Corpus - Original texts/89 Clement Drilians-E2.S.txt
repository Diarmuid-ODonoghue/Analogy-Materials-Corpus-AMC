Drilian Source.
A large, four legged creature celled a Drilian lives on the planet Munpar. Drilians are a highly intelligent and rather tense species.
Wumpums are relaxing.
Drilians have a fascinating reproductive process. They rely on the presence of a lower animal for reproduction. The reproductive process works in the following way. Each fertile Drilian, has a store of eggs (there are no sexes among Drilians). An egg begins to incubate when a Drilian is in the company of small fuzzy animals called Wumpums. Before incubation Drilian eggs are stored in a muscular sac inside the Drilian. When a Drilian is near a Wumpum the Drilian's body becomes extremely relaxed. When the egg sac relaxes it releases an egg. The egg then moves to a special area inside the Drilian where it begins to incubate. The egg incubates in this area for exactly one year. Then it is laid and is hatched immediately. Thus, even though Wumpums do not pass any genes to a new Drilian, their relaxing effect on a Drilian is essential to the reproduction process.
Powerful minds.
The planet Munpar where the Drilians live is a fertile environment hospitable to many infectious diseases. The Drilians have an unusual way of combating disease. They use mind control. Simply by thinking certain thoughts they can control their immune system. When a Drilian gets infected with a disease it can instruct its immune system to produce the correct anti bodies so that the Drilian can resist the disease. Moreover, a Drilian can spread this resistance to other Drilians. When a Drilian is instructing its immune system other Drilians pick up on the brain waves emitted by the Drilian and resonate with them. These other Drilians then have the instructions needed for their immune systems to resist the disease. As a result the Drilians are seldom troubled by epidemics.
