Unfortunately, many of the faculty in the Biology department at Fallsburg have strong
personalities and big egos. Inevitably, this has led to personality clashes among the faculty.
It is not uncommon for faculty meetings in this department to erupt into shouting matches.
One result of these arguments is that the faculty rarely go to their University offices, except
during office hours to avoid running into their colleagues. Because the faculty are rarely in
their offices, undergraduates and graduate students alike complain that the faculty are inaccessible.
   One of the most striking aspects of the Biology department is the tremendous financial
support for research. One result of this has been a high level of motivation for faculty members
to excel at their research. Faculty members in this department often spend long hours
on their research. This hard work has paid off, as the department is among the top 10 of all
Biology departments in its research reputation nationally.
