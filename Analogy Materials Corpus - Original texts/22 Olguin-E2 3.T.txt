I have a friend who had a concern regarding her hygiene and that made her start taking care of herself with regard to that aspect of her hygiene: She worried about the tartar on her teeth and this led her to brush her teeth more frequently.
Does this situation remind you of an analogous event that you have experienced? In case it did, please describe it to us.
