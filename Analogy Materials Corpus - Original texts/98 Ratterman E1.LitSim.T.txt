Literally similar story. 
Kevin was a shut-in at a mental institution. He always did poorly at the weekly bedroom checks so he disliked them. About the only thing Kevin liked to do was eat.
Not long before the last check of the year, Kevin's bedroom was still a disaster because he had spent all his time daydreaming. To motivate him, the matron promised Kevin a cake from the bakery if he cleaned and organized his bedroom.
This made Kevin extremely happy. But he was too far behind in his cleaning to get his bedroom ready in time. Consequently, he didn't get a cake after all.
