There once was a very jealous turtle who was friends with a giraffe. The turtle often said to the giraffe, "Don't ever-play with anyone else but me." 

One day the turtle went away on a trip and the giraffe had no one to play with. But then a ostrich came to visit the giraffe. He brought a wagon along and said, "Would you like to play with me and my wagon?". The giraffe said "Yes." The ostrich and the giraffe had a great time pulling each other around in the ostrich's wagon. 
When the turtle come back and found the giraffe playing with someone else he got very angry. He shouted, "I'll never play with you again!" The turtle was so angry that he jumped into the ostrich's wagon. But the wagon began to roll faster down a steep hill. The turtle was very scared. The ostrich jumped up and chased after the wagon so the turtle wouldn't crash. The ostrich stopped the runaway wagon and saved the turtle's life. 


In the end, the turtle realized that being jealous only got him into trouble. It is better to have two friends instead of one.
