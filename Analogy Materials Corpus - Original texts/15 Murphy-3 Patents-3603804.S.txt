
US Patent 3603804: Wave-operated power apparatus.
Abstract: An elongated U-shaped pipeline has floats
pivoted on transverse axes for rocking thereon in response
to wave action in water which the floats are buoyant.
Rocking of the floats operates pumps arranged in pressure
compounding relation, and the fluid under pressure is
delivered to a shore-based storage tank. The storage tank
being sealed allows buildup of a pressure head. The fluid is
let out through a regulator to operate machinery. Spent
fluid from the plant is spilled out into a recovery tank,
directly under the motor or turbine. It is then picked up by
the lower leg of the pipeline and returned to repeat its cycle
again. The floats support the pipeline and can be flooded to
sink below the surface to avoid damage by storm waves.
