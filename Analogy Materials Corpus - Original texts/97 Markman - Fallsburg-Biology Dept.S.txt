The biology department at Fallsburg teaches many of the pre-medical courses for the students, and also prides itself on maintaining an active research program. Over the last few years, a number of the older faculty have taken advantage of an early retirement program offered by the state, and, three younger faculty were lured to another school with offers of higher salaries. These departures have left the Biology department with fewer faculty than they would like to have. Because there are fewer faculty than are needed in this department, it has been difficult for them to carry out all of the administrative work that needs to be done. There are not enough faculty to organize meetings for faculty business and to advise majors in biology.
	The undergraduate students have consistently rated the faculty in this department as the best teachers on campus. Their reputation as fine teachers has spread throughout the campus so that almost every student wants to take at least one Biology course during their studies. This popularity has caused most of the Biology courses to be oversubscribed. Students must often wait over a year to get into the course of their choice.
