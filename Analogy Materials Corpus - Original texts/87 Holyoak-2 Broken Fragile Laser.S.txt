
In a physics lab at a major university, a very expensive lightbulb which would emit precisely controlled quantities of light was being used in some experiments. Ruth was the research assistant responsible for operating the sensitive lightbulb. One morning she came into the lab and found to her dismay that the lightbulb no longer worked. She realized that she had forgotten to turn it off the previous night. As a result the lightbulb overheated, and the filament inside the bulb had broken into two parts. The surrounding glass bulb was completely sealed, so there was no way to open it. Ruth knew that the lightbulb could be repaired if a brief, high-intensity laser beam could be used to fuse the two parts of the filament into one. Furthermore, the lab had the necessary equipment to do the job.

However, a high-intensity laser beam would also break the fragile glass surrounding the filament. At lower
intensities the [laser would not break the glass, but neither would it fuse the filament.
So it seemed that the lightbulb could not be repaired, and a costly replacement would be required.

Ruth was about to give up when she had an idea. She placed several lasers in a circle around the lightbulb,
and administered low-intensity laser beams from several directions all at once. The beams
all converged on the filament, where their combined effect was enough to fuse it. Since each spot on
the surrounding glass received only a low-intensity beam  from one laser, the glass was left intact.
Ruth was greatly relieved that the lightbulb was repaired, and she then went on to successfully complete the experiment.
