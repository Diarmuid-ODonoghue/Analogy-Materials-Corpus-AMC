Once upon a time
there lived a magical genie. He was a very old,
wise, and rich genie indeed. One day while he was
polishing his home, which was actually a bottle, an
old friend came up. The genie and his friend had
lived together long ago. They talked about how
much fun it had been to play and do magic together.
The genie's friend said, "I'm looking for a new
home right now." The genie said, "Let's find a bottle
big enough for both of us. Then we can live
together and have fun again." They began searching
far and wide for a bigger bottle. They searched and
they searched. Finally they found the perfect home,
a bottle that was big enough for both of them. The
genie was very excited. He wanted to move all his
belongings right away so he and his friend could 
	settle in. But the bottle was very far away and the
genie had many beautiful jewels to move. It would
be a lot easier for the genie to move if his new home
was closer to his old one. Now the genie had a prob-
"lemH. ow could he get his new bottle up close to his
old bottle?
	After thinking a bit the genie came up with a
wonderful idea. He began searching for his magic
staff, or wand. He then commanded his staff to
stretch itself from his old home to their new home.
Next, the genie tugged and pulled on his magical
staff until at last he pulled the new bottle right up
next to his old bottle. Then the genie was happy. He
could move in no time at all. He gathered up his
jewels in his old home and dropped them carefully
into their new home right next to him.
	Then the genie said to his friend, "What a wonderful
home! Now we can play and do magic together
every day." The genie's friend just smiled
and smiled. I'm sure you can still find the two of
them sitting in their bigger bottle playing and doing
magic even today!
