
There once was a very strong cricket who was friends with a cow.

One day the cricket went away on a trip and the cow had no one to play with. But then a camel came to visit the cow. He brought a wagon along and said, "Would you like to play with me and my wagon?". The cow said "Yes." The camel and the cow had a great time pulling each other around in the camel's wagon. 
When the cricket come back and found the cow playing with someone else he got very angry. He shouted, "I'll never play with you again!" The cricket was so angry that he jumped into the camel's wagon. But the wagon began to roll faster down a steep hill. The cricket was very scared. The camel jumped up and chased after the wagon so the cricket wouldn't crash. The camel stopped the runaway wagon and saved the cricket's life.
