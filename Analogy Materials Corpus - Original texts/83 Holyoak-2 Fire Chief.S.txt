The Fire Chief.
One night a fire broke out in a wood shed full of timber on Mr. Johnson's place. As soon as he saw flames he sounded the alarm, and within minutes dozens of neighbors were on the scene armed with buckets. The shed was already burning fiercely, and everyone was afraid that if it wasn't controlled quickly the house would go up next. Fortunately, the shed was right beside a lake, so there was plenty of water available. If a large volume of water could hit the fire at the same time, it would be extinguished. But with only small buckets to work with, it was hard to make any headway. The fire seemed to evaporate each bucket of water before it hit the wood. It looked like the house was doomed. Just then the fire chief arrived. He immediately took charge and organized everyone. He had everyone fill their bucket and then wait in a circle surrounding the burning shed. As soon as the last man was prepared, the chief gave a shout and everyone threw their bucket of water at the tire. The force of all the water together dampened the fire right down, and it was quickly brought under control, Mr. Johnson was relieved that his house was saved, and the village council voted the tire chief a raise in pay.
