There once was a very jealous bull who was friends with a mule. The bull often said to the mule, "Don't ever-play with anyone else but me." 

One day the bull went away on a trip and the mule had no one to play with. But then a ant came to visit the mule. He brought a wagon along and said, "Would you like to play with me and my wagon?". The mule said "Yes." The ant and the mule had a great time pulling each other around in the ant's wagon. 
When the bull come back and found the mule playing with someone else he got very angry. He shouted, "I'll never play with you again!" The bull was so angry that he jumped into the ant's wagon. But the wagon began to roll faster down a steep hill. The bull was very scared. The ant jumped up and chased after the wagon so the bull wouldn't crash. The ant stopped the runaway wagon and saved the bull's life. 


In the end, the bull realized that being jealous only got him into trouble. It is better to have two friends instead of one.
