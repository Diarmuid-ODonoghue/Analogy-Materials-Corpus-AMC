False Analogy Story.
Quiggly Company was a small company that manufactured conventional electrical components. They had just started producing integrated circuits and decided that the real action in the integrated circuit market was in space manufacturing. But the market analysts gave them a stern warning. They said that space factories were too expensive and that the market was too competitive. If Quiggly went into space manufacturing, the analysts predicted they would lose everything and their stock would plunge.
Quiggly Company was so annoyed at having to play it safe when everyone else had a chance to make a killing that they decided to go back to manufacturing conventional electric components.
