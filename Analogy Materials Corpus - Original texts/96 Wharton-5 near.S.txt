Kamor was a small country. One day Karnor realized
that its warlike neighbor, Gagrach, was arming against
them. The Karnorians realized that all of the Gagrach missiles
were badly made and decided that an alliance could be formed.
The Karnor ambassador gave a lot of missile components to the
Gagrach military. Gagrach indicated that they would never
make war on Karnor after this. However, the Gagrach declared
war on them during a holiday, while the Kamorians were feasting.
The rockets were now constructed with reliable Karnorian
components.
