The English department at Fallsburg is one of the largest departments at the University.
The undergraduate students have consistently rated the faculty in this department as the 
best teachers on campus. Their reputation as fine teachers has spread throughout the campus
so that almost every student wants to take at least one English course during their studies.
This popularity has caused most of the English courses to be oversubscribed. Students
must often wait over a year to get into the course of their choice.
   Unfortunately, many of the faculty in the English department have strong personalities
and big egos. Inevitably, this has led to personality clashes among the faculty. It is not
uncommon for faculty meetings in this department to erupt into shouting matches. One
result of these arguments is that the faculty rarely go to their University offices, except during
office hours to avoid running into their colleagues.
