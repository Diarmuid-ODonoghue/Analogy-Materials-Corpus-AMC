Luigi has a pizza truck in a very popular place. Lorenzo, another ambulant pizza chef, has placed his truck just beside Luigi’s and is detrimental to his turnover. Luigi realizes that the dough of Lorenzo’s pizzas is bland. Luigi spontaneously gives his personal recipe to Lorenzo so that he can improve the quality of his product. Since then, his pizza dough is amazingly tasty. The same evening, Lorenzo declares to Luigi that in order to show him how well-intended he found his act, he will move his truck in another sector, far from this one.
