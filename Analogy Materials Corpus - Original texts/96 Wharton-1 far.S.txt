Remote Cue.
Elle was a unicorn who wanted to see what was on the other side of the river. She thought the lands over there were enchanted
and rich with meadows and fruit trees. One day she set out to cross the river. Unfortunately, the water was very fast and too deep. Elle swam as hard as she could but after 20 minutes she had to turn back because of fatigue. Elle decided that the stories about the land on the other side of river werejust false rumors and that there was probably nothing of worth over there.
