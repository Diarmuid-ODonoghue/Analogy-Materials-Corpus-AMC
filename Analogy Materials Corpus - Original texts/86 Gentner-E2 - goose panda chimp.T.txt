There once was a very jealous goose who was friends with a panda. The goose often said to the panda, "Don't ever-play with anyone else but me." 

One day the goose went away on a trip and the panda had no one to play with. But then a chimp came to visit the panda. He brought a wagon along and said, "Would you like to play with me and my wagon?". The panda said "Yes." The chimp and the panda had a great time pulling each other around in the chimp's wagon. 
When the goose come back and found the panda playing with someone else he got very angry. He shouted, "I'll never play with you again!" The goose was so angry that he jumped into the chimp's wagon. But the wagon began to roll faster down a steep hill. The goose was very scared. The chimp jumped up and chased after the wagon so the goose wouldn't crash. The chimp stopped the runaway wagon and saved the goose's life. 


In the end, the goose realized that being jealous only got him into trouble. It is better to have two friends instead of one.
