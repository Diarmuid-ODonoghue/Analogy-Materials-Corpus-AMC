
There once was a very strong unicorn who was friends with a eel.

One day the unicorn went away on a trip and the eel had no one to play with. But then a dinosaur came to visit the eel. He brought a wagon along and said, "Would you like to play with me and my wagon?". The eel said "Yes." The dinosaur and the eel had a great time pulling each other around in the dinosaur's wagon. 
When the unicorn come back and found the eel playing with someone else he got very angry. He shouted, "I'll never play with you again!" The unicorn was so angry that he jumped into the dinosaur's wagon. But the wagon began to roll faster down a steep hill. The unicorn was very scared. The dinosaur jumped up and chased after the wagon so the unicorn wouldn't crash. The dinosaur stopped the runaway wagon and saved the unicorn's life.
