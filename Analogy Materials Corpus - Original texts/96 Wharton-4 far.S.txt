
Remote Cue: Denise, a beaver, loved her dam. However, she
hadn't used very strong branches before because she was inexperienced.
A very heavy winter snow caused the river to rise in
the spring and her dam was washed away. Denise wanted to fix
the dam but couldn't because river waters stayed so high. Finally
in the middle ofthe summer, the river came down. Denise
started to build the dam stronger and better than she had before.
