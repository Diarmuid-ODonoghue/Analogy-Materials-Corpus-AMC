
There once was a very strong bear who was friends with a porcupine.

One day the bear went away on a trip and the porcupine had no one to play with. But then a rabbit came to visit the porcupine. He brought a wagon along and said, "Would you like to play with me and my wagon?". The porcupine said "Yes." The rabbit and the porcupine had a great time pulling each other around in the rabbit's wagon. 
When the bear come back and found the porcupine playing with someone else he got very angry. He shouted, "I'll never play with you again!" The bear was so angry that he jumped into the rabbit's wagon. But the wagon began to roll faster down a steep hill. The bear was very scared. The rabbit jumped up and chased after the wagon so the bear wouldn't crash. The rabbit stopped the runaway wagon and saved the bear's life.
