False Analogy Story.
A girl named Cindy found some records she wanted at a record store.  She really wanted them but, needless to say, they were too expensive for her.
After brooding for awhile, Cindy got over her dissapointment.
These records are probably boring, she thought.  So even if I could afford them I wouldn't listen to them.
