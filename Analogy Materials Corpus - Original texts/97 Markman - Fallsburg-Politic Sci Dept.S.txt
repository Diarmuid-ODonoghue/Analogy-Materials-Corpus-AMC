The Political Science department has an odd mix of faculty. About half of the professors
have a strong interest in the role of Socialist and Marxist ideology in world government.
The other half of the faculty study the emergence of democratic republics, particularly in
Third World nations. Despite these radically different orientations, most of the professors
are quite open-minded. In fact, the department recently organized a conference at which
both groups gave talks about their findings. The conference was quite well received, and a
favorable story about the meeting appeared in The Washington Post.
Many of the faculty in the Political Science department got their degrees in the 1960s.
This era has clearly left its mark on the faculty. They are vocal proponents of environmental
causes, and they often encourage their students to speak out on these issues. Because of
their well-known stance as activists, many members of the faculty have been called to testify
before Congress.
