New Mere-Appearance Match.
Kevin was a shut-in at a mental institution. He loved to paint so he was also assigned the job of painting the recreation room. Every day one of the matrons stopped by to watch him paint. At lunch he used to go to the institution's bakery and get some cake. Unfortunately, this led to problems because he tended to drop cake crumbs into the paint. Luckily for him, when the matron visited she didn't notice that the rec room was not very neatly done.
