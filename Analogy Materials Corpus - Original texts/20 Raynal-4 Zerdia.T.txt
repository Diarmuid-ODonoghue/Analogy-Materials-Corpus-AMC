
Once there was an eagle named Zerdia who donated a few of
her tailfeathers to a sportsman so he would promise never to
attack eagles. One day Zerdia was nesting high on a rocky cliff
when she saw the sportsman coming with a crowsbow. Zerdia
flew down to meet the man, but he attacked and felled her with
a single bolt. As she fluttered to the ground Zerdia realized that
the bolt had her own tailfeathers on it.
