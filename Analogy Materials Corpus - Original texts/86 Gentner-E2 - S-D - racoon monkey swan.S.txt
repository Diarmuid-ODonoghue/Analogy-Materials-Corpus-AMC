There once was a very jealous racoon who was friends with a monkey. The racoon often said to the monkey, "Don't ever-play with anyone else but me." 

One day the racoon went away on a trip and the monkey had no one to play with. But then a swan came to visit the monkey. He brought a wagon along and said, "Would you like to play with me and my wagon?". The monkey said "Yes." The swan and the monkey had a great time pulling each other around in the swan's wagon. 
When the racoon come back and found the monkey playing with someone else he got very angry. He shouted, "I'll never play with you again!" The racoon was so angry that he jumped into the swan's wagon. But the wagon began to roll faster down a steep hill. The racoon was very scared. The swan jumped up and chased after the wagon so the racoon wouldn't crash. The swan stopped the runaway wagon and saved the racoon's life. 


In the end, the racoon realized that being jealous only got him into trouble. It is better to have two friends instead of one.
