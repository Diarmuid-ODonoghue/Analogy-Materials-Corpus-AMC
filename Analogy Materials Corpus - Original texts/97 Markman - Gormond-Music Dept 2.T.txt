The music department at Gordmont is a relatively new department, begun in 1987 in response to student pressure for more music classes. Because of the focus on undergraduate education at Gordmont, the University searched for the best instructors that it could find. The success of this effort is evident in the fact that the faculty in this department have been awarded the prestigious University Teaching Award in each of the last three years. Interestingly, because it is a new department, there has been a long period of adjustment in faculty relations. The faculty do not seem to get along well at all, and the members of the department seem to have little or no respect for each other.
