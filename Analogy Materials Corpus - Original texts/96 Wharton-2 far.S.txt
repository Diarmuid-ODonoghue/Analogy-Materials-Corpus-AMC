Jane was a unicorn who wanted to see what was on the other side ofthe river. She thought the lands over there were enchanted
and rich with meadows and fruit trees. One day she set out to cross the river. Unfortunately, the water was very fast and too deep. Jane swam as hard as she could but after 20 minutes she had to turn back, exhausted. Jane decided that she wasn't worthy of being in the magic lands.
