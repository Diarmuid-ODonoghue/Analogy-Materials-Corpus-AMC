I have a friend who felt admiration for the way in which someone resolved her conflicts in personal relationships and consequently he imitated that way of resolving conflicts in personal relationships: He admired how his partner faced the boss when he demanded more than he should and this made him imitate this way of confrontation with other people. Does this situation remind you of an analogous event that you have experienced? In case it did, please describe it to us.
