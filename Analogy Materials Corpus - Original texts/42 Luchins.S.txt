For this problem you are given a 21-quart jar, 127-quart jar and a 3-quart jar. Your challenge is to obtain exactly 100-quart of water.

So the solution can be produced as follows. One fills the 127-quart jar and from it fills the 21-quart jar once and the 3-quart jar twice. In the 127-quart jar there then remains the 100 quarts of water.
