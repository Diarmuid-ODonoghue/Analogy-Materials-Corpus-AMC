The music department at Gordmont is a relatively new department, begun in 1987 in response to student pressure for more music classes. Because of the focus on undergraduate education at Gordmont, the University searched for the best instructors that it could find. The success of this effort is evident in the fact that the faculty in this department have been awarded the prestigious University Teaching Award in each of the last three years. Interestingly, the music department is also the smallest on campus. Because it is a new department, it has taken some time to hire as many faculty as were originally planned when the department was formed.
