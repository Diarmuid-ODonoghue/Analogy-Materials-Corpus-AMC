Mere-Appearance Match.
Alexander was a wealthy man who employed two drivers for his two limousines. He liked to boast to his spouse that with his two drivers he would always be on time for his meetings.
One day, when he was in a rush, Alexander went to the first driver. But he was taking a nap. The driver thought it was his day off.
Then Alexander called for the other driver, but he had already left. He had seen Alexander with the first driver so he thought he had the day off.
Thus, Alexander ended up missing his meeting.
