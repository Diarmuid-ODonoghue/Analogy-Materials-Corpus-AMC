
There once was a very strong bobcat who was friends with a vulture. 

One day the bobcat went away on a trip and the vulture had no one to play with. But then a rhino came to visit the vulture. He brought a wagon along and said, "Would you like to play with me and my wagon?". The vulture said "Yes." The rhino and the vulture had a great time pulling each other around in the rhino's wagon. 
When the bobcat come back and found the vulture playing with someone else he got very angry. He shouted, "I'll never play with you again!" The bobcat was so angry that he jumped into the rhino's wagon. But the wagon began to roll faster down a steep hill. The bobcat was very scared. The rhino jumped up and chased after the wagon so the bobcat wouldn't crash. The rhino stopped the runaway wagon and saved the bobcat's life.
