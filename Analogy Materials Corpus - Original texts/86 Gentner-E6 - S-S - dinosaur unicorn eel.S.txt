There once was a very jealous dinosaur who was friends with a unicorn. The dinosaur often said to the unicorn, "Don't ever-play with anyone else but me." 

One day the dinosaur went away on a trip and the unicorn had no one to play with. But then a eel came to visit the unicorn. He brought a wagon along and said, "Would you like to play with me and my wagon?". The unicorn said "Yes." The eel and the unicorn had a great time pulling each other around in the eel's wagon. 
When the dinosaur come back and found the unicorn playing with someone else he got very angry. He shouted, "I'll never play with you again!" The dinosaur was so angry that he jumped into the eel's wagon. But the wagon began to roll faster down a steep hill. The dinosaur was very scared. The eel jumped up and chased after the wagon so the dinosaur wouldn't crash. The eel stopped the runaway wagon and saved the dinosaur's life. 


In the end, the dinosaur realized that being jealous only got him into trouble. It is better to have two friends instead of one.
