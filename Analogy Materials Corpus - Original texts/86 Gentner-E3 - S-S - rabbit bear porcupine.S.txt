There once was a very jealous rabbit who was friends with a bear. The rabbit often said to the bear, "Don't ever-play with anyone else but me." 

One day the rabbit went away on a trip and the bear had no one to play with. But then a porcupine came to visit the bear. He brought a wagon along and said, "Would you like to play with me and my wagon?". The bear said "Yes." The porcupine and the bear had a great time pulling each other around in the porcupine's wagon. 
When the rabbit come back and found the bear playing with someone else he got very angry. He shouted, "I'll never play with you again!" The rabbit was so angry that he jumped into the porcupine's wagon. But the wagon began to roll faster down a steep hill. The rabbit was very scared. The porcupine jumped up and chased after the wagon so the rabbit wouldn't crash. The porcupine stopped the runaway wagon and saved the rabbit's life. 


In the end, the rabbit realized that being jealous only got him into trouble. It is better to have two friends instead of one.
