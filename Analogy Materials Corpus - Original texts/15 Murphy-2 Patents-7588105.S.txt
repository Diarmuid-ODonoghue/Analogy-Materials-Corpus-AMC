Abstract: A virtual wheel provides a leg pair as a conveyance
mechanism for a land vehicle. The virtual wheel
propels the vehicle across a surface using a repetitive
motion of the legs that contact the ground as would a wheel,
due to their geometry. Vehicle embodiments include at least
two-, three-, four- and six-wheeled vehicles, both transverse
and in line. Additionally, the invention provides a bipedal
walking robot. One embodiment provides a robotic muleâ€”
a payload-carrying vehicle. The invention combines the
flexible mobility of bipedal vehicles with the stability and
functionality of very large-wheeled vehicles. Additionally,
a bimodal conveyance mechanism readily converts between
walking and rolling modes.
