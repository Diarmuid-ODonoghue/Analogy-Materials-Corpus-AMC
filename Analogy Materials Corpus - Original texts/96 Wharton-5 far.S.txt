
Remote Cue. June realized that her classmate Don didn't like
her. June decided to do something nice for Don so that he
wouldn't gossip about her. Don was an artist and was taking a
drawing course. June agreed to pose for him in a bathing suit at
the beach, and so Don seemed as ifhe now liked her. Later, at
the school library, Don showed some paintings. One of them
was an unflattering nude that was based on the beach drawing.
The painting was obviously recognizable as June.
