Abstract: A paper roll supplies a paper band through an
inlet opening in the housing of a business machine to a
platen which transports the paper band back toward the top
of the paper roll. When the diameter of the paper roll is
small, the paper band is curved and tends to reenter the
inlet opening which is prevented by a closure means
mounted on the carrier of the paper roll and substantially
closing the inlet opening when the carrier is displaced due
to the reduction in the diameter of the paper roll.
