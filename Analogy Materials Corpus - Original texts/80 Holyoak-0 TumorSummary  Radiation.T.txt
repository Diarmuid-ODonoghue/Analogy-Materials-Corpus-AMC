
A tumor was located in the interior of a patientâ€™s body.
A doctor wanted to destroy the tumor with rays.
The doctor wanted to prevent the rays from destroying healthy tissue.
As a result the high-intensity rays could not be applied to the tumor along one path. 

However, high-intensity rays were needed to destroy the tumor.
So applying one low-intensity ray would not succeed.
