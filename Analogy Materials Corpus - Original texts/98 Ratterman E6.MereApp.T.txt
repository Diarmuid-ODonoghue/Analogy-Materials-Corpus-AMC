Mere-Appearance Match.
A pony named Sidney found some apples resting on a beam in the barn.  He was starving, but they were out of reach.  Needless to say, he could not climb up the ladder to get them.
      After brooding for awhile, Sidney got over his disappointment. 
    These apples are probably all wormy, he thought.  So even if I could get one I would not want to eat it.
