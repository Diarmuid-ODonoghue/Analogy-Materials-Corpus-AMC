Slightly Extended.
A small country fell under the iron rule of a dictator. The dictator ruled
the country from a strong, brick fortress. The fortress was situated in
the middle of the country, surrounded by farms and villages. Many
roads radiated outward from the fortress like spokes on a wheel. A great
general, tall, and resplendent in his navy blue uniform, arose who
raised a large army at the border and vowed to capture the fortress and
free the country of the dictator. The general knew that if his entire army
could attack the fortress at once it could be captured. His troops were
poised at the head of one of the roads leading to the fortress, ready
to attack. However, a spy brought the general a disturbing report. The
ruthless dictator had planted mines on each of the roads. The mines
were set so that small bodies of men could pass over them safely, since
the dictator needed to be able to move troops and workers to and from
the fortress. However, any large forces would detonate the mines. Not
only would this blow up the road and render it impassable, but the dictator
would then destroy many villages in retaliation. A full scale direct
attack on the fortress therefore appeared impossible.
The general, however, was undaunted. He divided his army up into
small groups and dispatched each group to the head of a different road.
When all was ready he gave the signal, and each group charged down a
different road. All of the small groups passed safely over the mines, and
the army then attacked the fortress in full strength. In this way, the general
was able to capture the fortress and overthrow the dictator.
