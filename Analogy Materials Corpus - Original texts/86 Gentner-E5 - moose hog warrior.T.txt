There once was a very jealous moose who was friends with a hog. The moose often said to the hog, "Don't ever-play with anyone else but me." 

One day the moose went away on a trip and the hog had no one to play with. But then a warrior came to visit the hog. He brought a wagon along and said, "Would you like to play with me and my wagon?". The hog said "Yes." The warrior and the hog had a great time pulling each other around in the warrior's wagon. 
When the moose come back and found the hog playing with someone else he got very angry. He shouted, "I'll never play with you again!" The moose was so angry that he jumped into the warrior's wagon. But the wagon began to roll faster down a steep hill. The moose was very scared. The warrior jumped up and chased after the wagon so the moose wouldn't crash. The warrior stopped the runaway wagon and saved the moose's life. 


In the end, the moose realized that being jealous only got him into trouble. It is better to have two friends instead of one.
