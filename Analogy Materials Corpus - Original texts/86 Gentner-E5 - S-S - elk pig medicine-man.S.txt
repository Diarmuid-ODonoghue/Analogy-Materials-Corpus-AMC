There once was a very jealous elk who was friends with a pig. The elk often said to the pig, "Don't ever-play with anyone else but me." 

One day the elk went away on a trip and the pig had no one to play with. But then a medicine-man came to visit the pig. He brought a wagon along and said, "Would you like to play with me and my wagon?". The pig said "Yes." The medicine-man and the pig had a great time pulling each other around in the medicine-man's wagon. 
When the elk come back and found the pig playing with someone else he got very angry. He shouted, "I'll never play with you again!" The elk was so angry that he jumped into the medicine-man's wagon. But the wagon began to roll faster down a steep hill. The elk was very scared. The medicine-man jumped up and chased after the wagon so the elk wouldn't crash. The medicine-man stopped the runaway wagon and saved the elk's life. 


In the end, the elk realized that being jealous only got him into trouble. It is better to have two friends instead of one.
