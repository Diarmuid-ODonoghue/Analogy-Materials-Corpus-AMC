There once was a very jealous dragon who was friends with a horse. The dragon often said to the horse, "Don't ever-play with anyone else but me." 

One day the dragon went away on a trip and the horse had no one to play with. But then a snake came to visit the horse. He brought a wagon along and said, "Would you like to play with me and my wagon?". The horse said "Yes." The snake and the horse had a great time pulling each other around in the snake's wagon. 
When the dragon come back and found the horse playing with someone else he got very angry. He shouted, "I'll never play with you again!" The dragon was so angry that he jumped into the snake's wagon. But the wagon began to roll faster down a steep hill. The dragon was very scared. The snake jumped up and chased after the wagon so the dragon wouldn't crash. The snake stopped the runaway wagon and saved the dragon's life. 


In the end, the dragon realized that being jealous only got him into trouble. It is better to have two friends instead of one.
