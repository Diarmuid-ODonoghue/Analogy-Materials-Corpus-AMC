There once was a very jealous giraffe who was friends with a camel. The giraffe often said to the camel, "Don't ever-play with anyone else but me." 

One day the giraffe went away on a trip and the camel had no one to play with. But then a lion came to visit the camel. He brought a wagon along and said, "Would you like to play with me and my wagon?". The camel said "Yes." The lion and the camel had a great time pulling each other around in the lion's wagon. 
When the giraffe come back and found the camel playing with someone else he got very angry. He shouted, "I'll never play with you again!" The giraffe was so angry that he jumped into the lion's wagon. But the wagon began to roll faster down a steep hill. The giraffe was very scared. The lion jumped up and chased after the wagon so the giraffe wouldn't crash. The lion stopped the runaway wagon and saved the giraffe's life. 


In the end, the giraffe realized that being jealous only got him into trouble. It is better to have two friends instead of one.
