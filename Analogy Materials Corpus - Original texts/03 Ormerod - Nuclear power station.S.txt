A water pumping station in the hills above Peshawar has recently been adapted to feed a nuclear power facility, where the water acts as a coolant. Unfortunately the main pipe that leads from the water pumping station to the nuclear facility cannot stand the increased pressure and will eventually rupture. The nuclear power facility must have a continuous supply at a certain volume or it will overheat and go into meltdown. Experts have found that it is impossible to build a single large pipe to carry the water with the materials available that will not also rupture due to the high pressure of the water flowing through it. The suggestion is: to build a number of pipes that have less water pressure.
