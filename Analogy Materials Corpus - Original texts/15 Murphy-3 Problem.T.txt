Design a device to collect energy from human motion for use in developing and
impoverished rural communities in places like India and many African countries. Our
goal is to build a low-cost, easy to manufacture device targeted at individuals and
small households to provide energy to be stored in a battery. The energy is intended
to be used by small, low power draw electrics, such as a radio or lighting device,
hopefully leading to an increase in the quality of life of the communities by increasing
productivity, connection to the outside world, etc.
