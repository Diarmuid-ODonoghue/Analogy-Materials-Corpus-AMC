The Videogame Sales Case.
Vortex, Inc., a small video-arcade software firm, had a promising new line of special
forces videogames. Keppel and Co., a major manufacturer of video-arcade equipment in
Europe, was working with Vortex to produce the hardware needed for the special forces
games. They were negotiating over how to share revenues from their joint product. The deal
was mostly going smoothly - Vortex wanted to broaden the market for its products and
Keppel needed a boost in sales to meet their shareholders expectations for the year. However,
the two companies were struggling with how to split sales revenues. Keppel was
demanding a high percentage from sales to finance the added expense of a custom-made
action control for Vortex's games. Further, Keppel knew that it had the greatest resources to
get Vortex's special forces games on the market. On the other hand, Vortex was also
demanding a high percentage from sales on the grounds that what was being sold was their
games, they had the patent on the new action control, and Keppel was simply one of several
available manufacturers. Having negotiations at a standstill was bad for both companies
because Keppel needed to increase their sales by the end of the year and Vortex needed to
get their products out while they were still state of the art.
The breakthrough came when negotiators from Keppel and Vortex began discussing the
differing needs of their companies. The negotiation teams reached the following agreement:
Vortex would give up some of its share of revenue for the remainder of the year to cover
Keppel's production costs and to aid their current financial situation. In return, Keppel
would give up a comparable share of revenue in future fiscal years for these products, and
Vortex still maintained their patent on the new control device.
