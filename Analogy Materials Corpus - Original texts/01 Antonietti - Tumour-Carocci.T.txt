In a similar story, there is a group of climbers attempting to summit a treacherous mountain. One member of the group falls ill and cannot continue, but they are stranded on a steep and dangerous section of the mountain. The other climbers must find a way to rescue their teammate before it's too late. They have ropes and climbing gear, but the terrain is too unstable to climb down safely. They realize that if they extend the ropes and anchor them to a nearby summit, they can create a zip line to transport their teammate to safety. However, they must carefully calculate the length and tension of the ropes to ensure their teammate is transported safely. Through teamwork and ingenuity, they are able to rescue their friend without endangering themselves or anyone else.
