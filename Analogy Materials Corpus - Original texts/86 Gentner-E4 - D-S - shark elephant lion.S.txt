There once was a very jealous shark who was friends with a elephant. The shark often said to the elephant, "Don't ever-play with anyone else but me." 

One day the shark went away on a trip and the elephant had no one to play with. But then a lion came to visit the elephant. He brought a wagon along and said, "Would you like to play with me and my wagon?". The elephant said "Yes." The lion and the elephant had a great time pulling each other around in the lion's wagon. 
When the shark come back and found the elephant playing with someone else he got very angry. He shouted, "I'll never play with you again!" The shark was so angry that he jumped into the lion's wagon. But the wagon began to roll faster down a steep hill. The shark was very scared. The lion jumped up and chased after the wagon so the shark wouldn't crash. The lion stopped the runaway wagon and saved the shark's life. 


In the end, the shark realized that being jealous only got him into trouble. It is better to have two friends instead of one.
