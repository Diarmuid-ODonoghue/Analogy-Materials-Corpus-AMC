There once was a very jealous eagle who was friends with a hippo. The eagle often said to the hippo, "Don't ever-play with anyone else but me." 

One day the eagle went away on a trip and the hippo had no one to play with. But then a tiger came to visit the hippo. He brought a wagon along and said, "Would you like to play with me and my wagon?". The hippo said "Yes." The tiger and the hippo had a great time pulling each other around in the tiger's wagon. 
When the eagle come back and found the hippo playing with someone else he got very angry. He shouted, "I'll never play with you again!" The eagle was so angry that he jumped into the tiger's wagon. But the wagon began to roll faster down a steep hill. The eagle was very scared. The tiger jumped up and chased after the wagon so the eagle wouldn't crash. The tiger stopped the runaway wagon and saved the eagle's life. 


In the end, the eagle realized that being jealous only got him into trouble. It is better to have two friends instead of one.
