The Growth of the Veisel Plant.
A plant called a Veisel plant grows in a rain forest that covers the planet Funl.
Scientists have recently learned how new Veisel plants are generated. The scientists were amazed to discover that rain acts as one parent of a new plant. Periodically, the rain that falls is a naturally occurring acidic rain. The acids in this rain form a chemical bond with a Veisel plant's reproductive cells. The acids' special enzymes give a cell the additional substance needed to form a new plant. After the bond is fixed the cell begins to form into a new plant that is a product of the parent plant and the rain. When it reaches a certain size it is so heavy that it falls to the ground where it takes root. Thus, Veisel plants are an interesting example of the interaction among the elements of nature. Without the acidic rain new plants would not be generated.
The specific chemical content of some acidic rain is different from the content of other acidic rain. This causes slight differences among the Veisel plants. For example some rain contributes an enzyme that leads to large yellow flowers on the plant. Other rain creates a plant with smaller flowers that are bright blue in color.
Dangerous Insects.
Veisel plants are equipped with an effective way of protecting themselves from infestation by insects that can thrive on them. When a plant is invaded by some destructive insect the plant's protection system develops a special powder that tastes terrible to the insect. Eventually the terrible taste will cause the insect to leave the plant. The wonderful thing is that the powder is blown by breezes from one plant to the other Veisel plants in the area. As a result these plants also become protected from this insect. Thus, one plant can save a whole population of Veisel plants from infestation. Because of this, large scale insect infestations across the general Veisel plant population are extremely rare.
