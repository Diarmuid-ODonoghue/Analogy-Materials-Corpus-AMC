
Larry was infatuated with Wendy. Wendy got frustrated, began going out, and became close to a football player. Unfortunately, the football player didn't want to be tied down, so he started seeing other girls, and made up reasons why he didn't want to see her regularly. Larry heard about this, brought her flowers, and asked if she would go to the prom with him. On her own, Wendy had been hoping he would ask her.
