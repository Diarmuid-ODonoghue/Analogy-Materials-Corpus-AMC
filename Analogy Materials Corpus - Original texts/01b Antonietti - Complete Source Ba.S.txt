An engineer plans the construction of an artificial lake to produce electric
energy. According to his first plan, a unique wide canal collects water
coming from a valley and conveys it into the lake. The total labour cost for
the construction of such a canal is $17,664. However, the engineer realizes
that during the flood periods the stream of water flowing along the canal
may be too strong and may damage the surrounding areas. He also realizes
that during the drought periods a unique stream of water may be insufficient
to feed the lake.
To avoid these mishaps, the engineer elaborates a second plan.
According to this plan, the lake is fed by four small canals whose total flow
is the same as the unique wide canal previously planned. These small canals
are placed around the lake so that they convey water coming from four different
valleys.
In this way only small amounts of water can flow in each canal and thus
during flood periods dangerous overflowings might not occur. At the same
time, the lake is fed by water from various belts, so that also during drought
periods it is sufficiently fed. To implement the second plan 12 laborers have
to work 8 hours daily for 23 days. Each laborer is paid $8 for each hour of
work. The total labour of the second plan is cheaper, equal or more expensive
than the labour of the first plan?
