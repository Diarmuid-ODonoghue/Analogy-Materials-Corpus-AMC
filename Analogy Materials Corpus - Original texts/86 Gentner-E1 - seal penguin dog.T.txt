There once was a very jealous seal who was friends with a penguin. The seal often said to the penguin, "Don't ever-play with anyone else but me." 

One day the seal went away on a trip and the penguin had no one to play with. But then a dog came to visit the penguin. He brought a wagon along and said, "Would you like to play with me and my wagon?". The penguin said "Yes." The dog and the penguin had a great time pulling each other around in the dog's wagon. 
When the seal come back and found the penguin playing with someone else he got very angry. He shouted, "I'll never play with you again!" The seal was so angry that he jumped into the dog's wagon. But the wagon began to roll faster down a steep hill. The seal was very scared. The dog jumped up and chased after the wagon so the seal wouldn't crash. The dog stopped the runaway wagon and saved the seal's life. 


In the end, the seal realized that being jealous only got him into trouble. It is better to have two friends instead of one.
