There once was a very jealous ostrich who was friends with a turtle. The ostrich often said to the turtle, "Don't ever-play with anyone else but me." 

One day the ostrich went away on a trip and the turtle had no one to play with. But then a giraffe came to visit the turtle. He brought a wagon along and said, "Would you like to play with me and my wagon?". The turtle said "Yes." The giraffe and the turtle had a great time pulling each other around in the giraffe's wagon. 
When the ostrich come back and found the turtle playing with someone else he got very angry. He shouted, "I'll never play with you again!" The ostrich was so angry that he jumped into the giraffe's wagon. But the wagon began to roll faster down a steep hill. The ostrich was very scared. The giraffe jumped up and chased after the wagon so the ostrich wouldn't crash. The giraffe stopped the runaway wagon and saved the ostrich's life. 


In the end, the ostrich realized that being jealous only got him into trouble. It is better to have two friends instead of one.
