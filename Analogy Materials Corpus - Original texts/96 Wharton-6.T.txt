
One day, lying on a big boulder, was a snake called Elrod. He saw a hunter coming with a blow gun tracking him. The hunter fired. Elrod realized that the darts had no poison and so he realized that he might be able to make a trade. He crawled over and gave some poison to the hunter so that the darts now had his poison on them. The hunter agreed never to kill snakes again.
