Abstract: An internal combustion engine and its method
of operation including at least one embodiment operating
on a six-stroke cycle and including at least one piston and
cylinder assembly. The six-stroke cycle includes two
power strokes, the latter of which is the result of a water-tosteam
conversion process utilizing the heat of the exhaust
gas from the first power stroke. A second embodiment
comprises a hybrid power generating assembly incorporating
alternative, first and second power sources, respectively,
comprising an internal combustion engine and a
water injection engine, the latter of which operates on the
water-to-steam conversion process, wherein the required
heat therefore is derived from the exhaust gas of the
internal combustion engine. Another preferred embodiment
comprises the utilization of different normally wasted heat
sources from an IC engine for the generation of sufficient
work energy to drive a power takeoff, such as hybrid drive
assembly.
