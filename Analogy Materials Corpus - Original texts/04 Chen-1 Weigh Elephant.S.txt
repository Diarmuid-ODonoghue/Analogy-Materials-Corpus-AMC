
Long ago in China, there lived a powerful emperor. Every year, the
rulers of the surrounding countries had to give him jewelry, gold, cloth
materials, and animals as presents. One day, a ruler of a southern country
presented him with an elephant as a gift. The emperor was delighted to see
the elephant and asked the ruler what the weight of the elephant was. The
ruler was embarrassed because even the biggest scale he owned was too
small to weigh the huge elephant. The emperor’s youngest son, named
Chao Chong, came up with an idea: "You could find a boat, put the
elephant in it, and mark the new water level on the boat. Then, you could
take the elephant out of the boat and put smaller stones into the boat until
the water level reaches the same mark. Then, you could weigh those stones
separately with a small scale. When you add up all the weights, you would
know how heavy the elephant is." Everyone was surprised and impressed
by the boy’s solution.
