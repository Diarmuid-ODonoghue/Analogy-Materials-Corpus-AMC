Mere-Appearance Match.
Alfred was a man from Sweden who was vacationing in Hawaii. He wanted to impress his friends with a dark tan, so one day he went out to spend the. afternoon in the sun. But a doctor acquaintance chanced to pass by and gave Alfred a stern warning. If Alfred stayed in the sun, by nightfall he would have a terrible sunburn and would need medication.
Alfred was so annoyed at having to remain so pale when everyone else was tan that he decided to go back to Sweden.

New Mere-Appearance Match.
Alfred was a young man with a Swedish last mane. Alfred lived in the Bahamas and had very dark skin because he spent a great deal of time in the sun.
Alfred had a job in a medical clinic and constantly saw people who had overdone it and gotten terrible sunburns. They were always embarrassed about being so silly. But Alfred never had any problems. In fact he would spend whole weekends sunning himself on a big pleasure cruiser.
