One unusually warm spell in February Sam the magpie thought "This is my chance." 
He stood up on the edge of his nest and trilled proudly. 
His song was so loud and cheerful that it woke a nearby chipmunk. 
The chipmunk asked for another song. 
He was so moved by Sam's talents that he forgot it was still winter and decided to go looking for nuts to store.
