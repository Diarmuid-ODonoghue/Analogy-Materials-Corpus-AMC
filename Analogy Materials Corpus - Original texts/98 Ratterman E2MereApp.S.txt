"Mr. Boyce was director of manufacturing shaving knives for Gilette Company. In 1980, an engineer in his company perfected a steel alloy that would keep a finer edge than any previous blade. Because it was so sharp, the engineer also recommended a new protective part that would prevent people from hurting themselves with the blade.
But Mr. Boyce considered the protective part unnecessary. It would be too expensive to incorporate.
But later, when he was using one of these new blades, he slashed his own throat pretty seriously. After this accident he was so frightened that he had the protective part developed immediately".
