A general was trying to destroy an intercontinental ballistic missile, using a type of laser beam, which would be entering the atmosphere at great speeds. He needed to use a high-powered laser beam in order to destroy the incoming missile. However, such high-powered laser beams were inaccurate because they would heat up the air through which they passed, thus distorting the beam.
After considerable thought, he knew what to do. He divided the high-powered laser beams into a number of low-powered laser beams and, by sending these low-powered laser beams, simultaneously, from a number of different directions, they converged on the missile making up a sufficiently powerful beam to destroy it.
