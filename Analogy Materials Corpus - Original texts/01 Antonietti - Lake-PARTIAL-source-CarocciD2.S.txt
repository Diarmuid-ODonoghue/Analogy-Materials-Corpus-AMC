An engineer plans the construction of an artificial lake to produce electric energy. According to his first plan, a unique white canal collects water coming from a valley and conveys it to the lake. The total labour cost for the construction of such a canal is $17,664. However, the engineer realizes that during the flood periods the stream of water flowing along the canal may be too strong and may damage the surrounding areas. In order to avoid this mishap, the engineer elaborates a second plan. According to this plan the lake is fed by four parallel small canals whose total flow is the same as the unique white canal previously planned. In this way only small amounts of water can flow in each canal and thus during flood periods dangerous overflowing might not occur. To implement the second plan 12 laborers have to work 8 hours daily for 23 days. Each labor is paid $8 for each hour of work. The total labor of the second plan is cheaper equal or more expensive than the labor of the first plan?
