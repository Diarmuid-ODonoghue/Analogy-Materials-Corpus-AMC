The English Department is one of the largest departments at Fallsburg. Unfortunately,
many of the faculty in the English department have strong personalities and big egos. Inevitably,
this has led to personality clashes among the faculty. It is not uncommon for faculty
meetings in this department to erupt into shouting matches. One result of these arguments
is that the faculty rarely go to their University offices, except during office hours to avoid
running into their colleagues.
The faculty in English are quite active researchers, and almost all of them have research
grants from large government agencies. These grants provide the department with money
to hire personnel. Because of the large number of grants, the department has been able to
hire research assistants for every faculty member.
