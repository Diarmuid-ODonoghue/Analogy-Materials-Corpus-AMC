Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's a new story that is analogous to the given story:
There once was a very possessive cat who was friends with a fox. The cat often said to the fox, "Don't ever play with anyone else but me." One day the cat went away on a trip and the fox had no one to play with. But then a rabbit came to visit the fox. He brought a ball along and said, "Would you like to play catch with me?" The fox said "Yes." The rabbit and the fox had a great time playing catch together. When the cat come back and found the fox playing with someone else he got very angry. He shouted, "I'll never play with you again!" The cat was so angry that he jumped into the rabbit's burrow. But the burrow began to collapse and the cat was trapped. The rabbit jumped up and chased after the cat so he wouldn't get hurt. The rabbit saved the cat's life and in the end, the cat realized that being possessive only got him into trouble. It is better to have two friends instead of one.
