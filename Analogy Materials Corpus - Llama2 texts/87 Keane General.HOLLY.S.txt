Certainly! Here's a new story that is analogous to the given story:
A group of thieves were trying to break into a high-security vault that was located in the heart of a bustling city. The vault was surrounded by layers of security, including cameras, alarms, and a team of highly trained guards. The thieves knew that they couldn't take on the guards directly, so they came up with a clever plan. They divided themselves into small groups, each one targeting a different entry point to the vault. They snuck in through ventilation shafts, sewer tunnels, and even disguised themselves as maintenance workers. As they converged on the vault from multiple angles, they were able to bypass the security measures and break in undetected. Once inside, they were able to crack the vault's combination and make off with the valuable treasure inside.
In this new story, the thieves are like the general in the original story, using a divide and conquer strategy to overcome the security measures surrounding the vault. By dividing themselves into small groups and attacking from different angles, they were able to outsmart the guards and security systems, and successfully break into the vault.
