Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's a new story that is analogous to the given story:
The History department at Willow Creek University is one of the most popular departments on campus. The undergraduate students have consistently rated the faculty in this department as the best teachers on campus. Their reputation as engaging and knowledgeable instructors has spread throughout the campus so that almost every student wants to take at least one History course during their studies. This popularity has caused most of the History courses to be oversubscribed. Students must often wait over a year to get into the course of their choice. Unfortunately, many of the faculty in the History department have strong personalities and big egos. Inevitably, this has led to personality clashes among the faculty. It is not uncommon for faculty meetings in this department to erupt into heated debates. One result of these arguments is that the faculty rarely go to their University offices, except during office hours to avoid running into their colleagues.
In this new story, the department is called the History department instead of the English department, but the similarities in the situation are still evident. The popularity of the History department among undergraduate students has led to oversubscription of courses, and the faculty members have strong personalities and big egos, leading to personality clashes and heated debates during faculty meetings. Just like in the original story, the faculty members rarely go to their University offices outside of office hours to avoid running into their colleagues.
