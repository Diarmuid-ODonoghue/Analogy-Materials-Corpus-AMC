Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's a new story that is analogous to the given story:
The psychology department at Willow Creek University has been facing a similar challenge as the biology department at Fallsburg. With several faculty members retiring or leaving for other opportunities, the department is now understaffed and struggling to keep up with administrative tasks and advising students. Despite the challenges, the psychology faculty has maintained their reputation as excellent teachers, and students are eager to take their courses. As a result, many courses are oversubscribed, and students often have to wait a year or more to enroll in the classes they want.
In this new story, the department is facing a similar shortage of faculty, which is impacting their ability to handle administrative tasks and advise students. However, the faculty is still highly regarded as teachers, and students are eager to take their courses. The oversubscription of courses is also a challenge in this story, as students have to wait a long time to enroll in the classes they want.
I hope this new story is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.
