 One day, perched on a tall tree branch, was a bird named Luna. She saw a farmer approaching with a net, trying to catch her. Luna realized that the farmer was not after her, but rather after the delicious berries she had been eating from the nearby bushes. Without hesitation, Luna flew down and offered the farmer some of her own berries in exchange for sparing her life. The farmer, grateful for the offer, agreed never to harm any birds again. Just like Elrod the snake in the original story, Luna the bird took action to prevent harm from coming to herself and her fellow creatures. By offering a trade, she was able to come to a peaceful resolution with the farmer and save her own life.
