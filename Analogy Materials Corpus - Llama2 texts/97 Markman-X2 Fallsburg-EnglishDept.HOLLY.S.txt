Sure, I'd be happy to suggest a new story that is analogous to the given story. Here it is:
In the early 2000s, many of the faculty in the History department earned their degrees. This era has clearly left its mark on the faculty. They are vocal proponents of social justice causes, and they often encourage their students to speak out on these issues. Because of their well-known stance as activists, many members of the faculty have been called to testify before Congress. As a result, many members of this department have become recognizable faces on television news programs. The History department faculty also have excellent reputations as teachers. Not only are the faculty in this department extremely knowledgeable, they are able to present complex historical events in a clear and engaging manner. Because of this teaching skill, the History faculty have developed a rather haughty attitude, and often look down on members of other departments. As a result, the members of the History department are resented by many faculty from other departments.
In this new story, the department in question is the History department instead of the English department. The specific issues that the faculty are passionate about are social justice causes, rather than environmental causes. However, the dynamic of the faculty members being seen as activists and being called to testify before Congress remains the same. Additionally, the faculty members in this department are known for their excellent teaching skills, which leads to a haughty attitude towards other departments.
