Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's a new story that is analogous to the given story:
There once was a very possessive cat who was friends with a rabbit. The cat often said to the rabbit, "Don't ever play with anyone else but me." One day the cat went away on a trip and the rabbit had no one to play with. But then a squirrel came to visit the rabbit. He brought a ball along and said, "Would you like to play with me and my ball?". The rabbit said "Yes." The squirrel and the rabbit had a great time playing catch with the ball. When the cat come back and found the rabbit playing with someone else he got very angry. He shouted, "I'll never play with you again!" The cat was so angry that he jumped into the squirrel's ball. But the ball began to roll faster down a steep hill. The cat was very scared. The squirrel jumped up and chased after the ball so the cat wouldn't crash. The squirrel stopped the runaway ball and saved the cat's life. In the end, the cat realized that being possessive only got him into trouble. It is better to have two friends instead of one.
