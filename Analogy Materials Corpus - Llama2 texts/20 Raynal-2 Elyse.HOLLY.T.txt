 Sarah and John have been married for over a decade and have two young children, Emily and Jack. They have been living in a cozy apartment in the city, but with their growing family, they are finding it increasingly difficult to accommodate their needs. They have been considering moving to a larger house in the suburbs to provide their children with more space to grow and play. However, Sarah recently discovered that John has been secretly meeting with another woman, and this has left her feeling hurt and betrayed. In this new story, Sarah is faced with a difficult decision: should she stay in the apartment and work through her feelings, or should she leave and start a new life for herself and her children? Just as Elyse in the original story, Sarah must weigh the pros and cons of each option and decide what is best for her and her family. Here are some questions you could ask to further develop this story: * How does Sarah feel about John's infidelity, and how does it affect her decision-making process? * How do the children react to the news of John's infidelity, and how does it impact their lives? * What are the financial implications of moving to a larger house, and how does Sarah weigh these against the emotional benefits of starting a new life? * How does Sarah's decision ultimately affect her relationship with John and their children, and what does the future hold for them as a family?
