Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's a new story that is analogous to the given story:
In a chemistry lab at a prestigious university, a very expensive reaction vessel was being used in some experiments. Emily was the research assistant responsible for operating the vessel. One morning she came into the lab and found to her dismay that the vessel was no longer working. She realized that she had forgotten to turn it off the previous night. As a result, the vessel had overheated, and the seal around the lid had become loose, causing the contents to spill out. Emily knew that the vessel could be repaired if a specialized cleaning solution could be used to remove the residue from the lid and re-seal it. However, the cleaning solution was expensive and the lab did not have any. Furthermore, the vessel was so delicate that any rough handling could cause it to break. Emily was about to give up when she had an idea. She placed several cleaning solutions in a circle around the vessel, and administered low-intensity cleaning waves from several directions all at once. The waves all converged on the lid, where their combined effect was enough to remove the residue and re-seal the vessel. Since each spot on the vessel received only a low-intensity wave from one cleaning solution, the vessel was left undamaged. Emily was greatly relieved that the vessel was repaired, and she then went on to successfully complete the experiment.
