 The mathematics department at the prestigious University of Eldrid is renowned for producing some of the brightest minds in the field. Over the past decade, the department has consistently ranked among the top five in the world, with a faculty that includes several Nobel laureates and Fields Medal winners. However, the department's success has come at a cost. The professors are notoriously difficult to work with, often engaging in bitter feuds and rivalries that make it challenging for students and colleagues to navigate the department's halls. Despite this, the department's reputation for producing groundbreaking research has only grown, with each professor determined to outdo their peers in the race for academic glory.
