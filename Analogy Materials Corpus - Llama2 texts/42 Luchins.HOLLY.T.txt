 You are a skilled sailor who has been tasked with transporting a valuable cargo of water from one island to another. The catch is that the islands are separated by a treacherous sea, and you only have access to three different sized barrels to carry the water in. The 21-quart barrel is small, but it can hold a lot of water, the 127-quart barrel is medium sized, and the 3-quart barrel is the smallest of the three. Your goal is to transport exactly 100-quart of water from the first island to the second island using only these three barrels. Can you think of a way to solve this problem?
