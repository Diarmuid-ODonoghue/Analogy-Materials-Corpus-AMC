 You find yourself in a mysterious room with two walls that are connected by a small opening. The walls are made of a smooth, slippery material that makes it impossible to climb or crawl through the opening. You are standing in front of one of the walls, and the other wall is located on the opposite side of the room. To make things more challenging, there are several objects placed around the room that could potentially help you reach the other wall, but they are all too far away to reach without some sort of assistance. For example, there is a long, flexible pole that could be used to extend your reach, but it's too far away to grab hold of. There is also a heavy weight that could be used to create a lever, but it's too heavy to lift on your own. Your goal is to find a way to tie the two ends of the wall together, but the catch is that you can only use the objects in the room to help you. Can you come up with a creative solution to solve the puzzle and unite the two walls?
