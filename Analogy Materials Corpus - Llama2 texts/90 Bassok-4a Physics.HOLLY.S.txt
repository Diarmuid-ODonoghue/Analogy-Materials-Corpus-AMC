Of course! I'd be happy to help you with that.
To answer your question, we need to use the information provided in the problem:
1. The rate at which the precipitate forms is 13.7 mg per second.
2. The concentration of the solution changes as the precipitation proceeds, and the precipitation rate decreases by 1.2 mg per second every second.
From these two pieces of information, we can set up a mathematical equation that describes the relationship between the rate of precipitation and the total amount of precipitate formed.
Let's assume that the total amount of precipitate formed during the 10-second period is represented by the variable "X".
We know that the rate of precipitation is 13.7 mg per second, so the total amount of precipitate formed during the 10-second period is:
X = 13.7 mg/s x 10 s = 137 mg
However, as the concentration of the solution changes, the rate of precipitation decreases by 1.2 mg per second every second. So, the total amount of precipitate formed during the 10-second period can also be expressed as:
X = 13.7 mg/s x (10 s - 10/2 = 5 s) = 68.5 mg
Therefore, the total amount of precipitate formed during the 10-second period is 68.5 mg.
