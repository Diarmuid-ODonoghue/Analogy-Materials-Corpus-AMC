Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's a new story that is analogous to the given story:
The Book Publishing Deal. Greenwood Press, a small publishing house, had a promising new novel that they believed would be a bestseller. Literati Press, a major publisher, was interested in publishing the book but was negotiating over the terms of the deal. Literati wanted a high percentage of the profits from the book's sales to cover the added expense of printing and marketing. Greenwood, on the other hand, believed that they had the expertise and resources to get the book on the bestseller list and wanted a higher percentage of the profits to reflect their contribution. The negotiations had reached a standstill, with both sides unwilling to compromise. However, the breakthrough came when the negotiators from Greenwood and Literati began discussing the differing needs of their companies. Greenwood agreed to give up some of their share of the profits for the remainder of the year to cover Literati's production costs and to aid their current financial situation. In return, Literati agreed to give up a comparable share of profits in future fiscal years, and Greenwood still maintained their creative control over the book.
