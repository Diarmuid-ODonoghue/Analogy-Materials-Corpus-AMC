 There once was a very possessive gardener who was friends with a beautiful flower. The gardener often said to the flower, "Don't ever bloom for anyone else but me." One day the gardener went away on a trip and the flower had no one to talk to. But then a butterfly came to visit the flower. He brought a bee along and said, "Would you like to dance with me and my bee?". The flower said "Yes." The butterfly and the flower had a great time dancing together. When the gardener come back and found the flower dancing with someone else he got very angry. He shouted, "I'll never talk to you again!" The gardener was so angry that he jumped into the butterfly's bee. But the bee began to fly faster and faster. The gardener was very scared. The butterfly jumped up and chased after the bee so the gardener wouldn't crash. The butterfly stopped the runaway bee and saved the gardener's life. In the end, the gardener realized that being possessive only got him into trouble. It is better to have two friends instead of one.
