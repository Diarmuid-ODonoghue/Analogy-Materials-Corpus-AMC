Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's a new story that is analogous to the given story:
An architect plans the construction of a new skyscraper to house a tech company. According to his first plan, a unique wide foundation collects water coming from the ground and conveys it to the building. The total labor cost for the construction of such foundation is $17,664. However, the architect realizes that during dry periods the foundation may not be able to hold enough water for the building. In order to avoid this mishap, the architect elaborates a second plan. According to this plan, the building is fed by four underground water tanks placed around the foundation. These tanks are filled with water from various underground sources, so that also during dry periods the building is sufficiently watered. To implement the second plan 12 construction workers have to work 8 hours daily for 23 days. Each worker is paid $8 for each hour of work. The total labor of the second plan is cheaper, equal or more expensive than the labor of the first plan?
