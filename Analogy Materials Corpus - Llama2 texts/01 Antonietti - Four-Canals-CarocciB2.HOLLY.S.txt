Certainly! Here's a new story that is analogous to the given story:
A farmer had to plan the irrigation of his fields to ensure a bountiful harvest. To feed his fields he thought to build a unique wide ditch collecting water from a nearby river. However, a gardener pointed out that during heavy rainfall periods the stream of water flowing along the ditch might be too strong and might damage the surrounding crops; By contrast, during periods of drought the stream of water might be insufficient to support the growth of the plants.
In order to avoid these mishaps, the gardener suggested to build, instead of a unique wide ditch, four small ditches whose total flow was the same as the unique wide ditch previously planned. These small ditches were placed around the fields so that they conveyed water from four different river sources. In this way only small amounts of water could flow in each ditch and thus during heavy rainfall periods dangerous overflowing might not occur. At the same time the fields were fed by water from various sources, so that also during drought periods they were sufficiently irrigated.
