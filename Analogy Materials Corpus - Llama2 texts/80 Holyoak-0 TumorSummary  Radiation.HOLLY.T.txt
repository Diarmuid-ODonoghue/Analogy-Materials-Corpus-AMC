 A group of scientists were working on a top-secret project to create a new form of sustainable energy. They had discovered a unique way to harness the power of the sun and convert it into a usable form of energy. However, their experiment was located deep within a remote desert cave, and they needed to find a way to extract the energy without disrupting the delicate ecosystem of the cave. As they began to set up their equipment, they realized that the cave was home to a rare and endangered species of bat. The scientists knew that they couldn't risk disturbing the bat's habitat, but they also couldn't afford to lose the opportunity to harness the power of the sun. They were faced with a difficult decision: should they risk disturbing the bat's habitat and potentially harming the species, or should they abandon their experiment and miss out on a chance to make a groundbreaking discovery? In this new story, the scientists are faced with a similar dilemma as the doctor in the original story. They need to find a way to destroy the tumor without harming the surrounding healthy tissue, but they also need to be careful not to disturb the delicate ecosystem of the cave. Just as the doctor in the original story needed to find a way to destroy the tumor without harming the patient, the scientists in this story need to find a way to harness the power of the sun without harming the bat or the cave's ecosystem.
