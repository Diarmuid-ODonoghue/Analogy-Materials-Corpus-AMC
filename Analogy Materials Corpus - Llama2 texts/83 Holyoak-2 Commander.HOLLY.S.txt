Great! Here's a new story that is analogous to the given story:
The Senator. A political government was established after the elected government was toppled in a coup. The military imposed martial law and abolished all civil liberties. A senator and his allies remained loyal to the overthrown civilian government. They hid in a bunker waiting for a chance to launch a counterattack. The senator felt he could succeed if only the military headquarters could be captured. The headquarters was located on a heavily guarded fortress situated in the center of a large city. The only way to reach the fortress was by way of several tunnels that connected it to the surrounding area. However, each tunnel was so narrow and unstable that only a few soldiers could crawl through at once. Such a small force would easily be repulsed by the defending troops. The senator therefore tried an unexpected tactic. He secretly sent a number of soldiers to locations near each tunnel leading to the fortress. Then under cover of darkness the attack was launched simultaneously across each tunnel. All of the groups of soldiers arrived on the fortress together and immediately converged on the military headquarters. They managed to capture the headquarters and eventually restore the civilian government.
