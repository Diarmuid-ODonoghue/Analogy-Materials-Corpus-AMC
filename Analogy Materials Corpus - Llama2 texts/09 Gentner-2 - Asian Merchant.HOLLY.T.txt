 Mia, a recent startup founder in the tech industry, had just closed a major deal with a large multinational corporation to license her innovative software technology. The deal was significant for Mia's small startup, as it would provide the necessary funding to take her product to the next level. However, there was a catch - the corporation wanted to pay in installments, and Mia was concerned about the potential risks of working with such a large and unfamiliar entity. The corporation's representative assured Mia that they had a proven track record of successful payments and that they would make sure to pay her in a timely manner. However, Mia was not convinced and wanted to ensure that she would receive the full amount of the deal. After some negotiation, Mia proposed a compromise - the corporation would pay a portion of the deal upfront, and the remaining amount would be paid in installments, but with a clause that if the corporation failed to make a payment within a certain timeframe, Mia would receive a percentage of the total deal amount as liquidated damages. Both parties agreed to the proposal, and the deal was finalized. In this new story, Mia is the protagonist who is trying to protect her startup's interests in a deal with a large multinational corporation. Like Syd in the original story, Mia is concerned about the potential risks of working with such a large entity and wants to ensure that she receives the full amount of the deal. Unlike Syd, Mia is proactive in proposing a compromise that benefits both parties and helps to mitigate the risks of the deal.
