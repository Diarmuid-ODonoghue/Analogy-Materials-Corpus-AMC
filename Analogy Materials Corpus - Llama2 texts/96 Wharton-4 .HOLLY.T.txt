 Mia was captivated by Ethan. Ethan grew tired of her constant attention and began spending time with a new acquaintance, Rachel, who was also interested in him. Despite Ethan's growing feelings for Rachel, he continued to lead Mia on, giving her false hopes and excuses for why he couldn't spend time with her. Mia, still harboring feelings for Ethan, was thrilled when he asked her to the spring formal. On her own, Rachel had been hoping Ethan would ask her to the dance. In this new story, Mia is similar to Wendy in that they are both infatuated with a boy who doesn't reciprocate their feelings. Ethan, like the football player in the original story, is the object of their affections but doesn't want to be tied down. When Ethan asks Mia to the spring formal, it is a surprise to her, as she had been hoping he would ask her. Similarly, when Larry asks Wendy to the prom, it is a welcome surprise to her, as she had been hoping he would ask her.
