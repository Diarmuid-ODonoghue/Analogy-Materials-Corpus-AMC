 Once there was a fox named Felix. He saw a farmer armed with a pitchfork coming after him. Felix noticed that some of the tines of the pitchfork had been sharpened. He thought that he might be able to strike a deal. Felix approached the farmer and offered to help him protect his crops from other animals in exchange for the farmer's promise never to use the sharpened tines against him. One day, while Felix was out foraging for food, the farmer came after him with the pitchfork. But this time, the tines were covered in Felix's own fur, which he had donated to the farmer in secret.
