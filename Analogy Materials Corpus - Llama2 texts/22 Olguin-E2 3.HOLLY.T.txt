 Certainly! I can definitely relate to your friend's concern about her hygiene and the steps she took to address it. In fact, I have a similar experience that comes to mind. A few years ago, I noticed that I was having trouble keeping my hair clean and manageable. No matter how often I washed it, it always seemed to be greasy and unruly. I worried that it might be a sign of poor hygiene, so I started paying more attention to my hair care routine. I began using a clarifying shampoo and conditioner, and I made sure to wash my hair every day, even if it was just a quick rinse with water. As it turned out, my hair was just prone to oiliness, and with a little more attention and care, I was able to keep it looking and feeling great. It was a small change, but it made a big difference in how I felt about my appearance and overall self-care. In the same way, your friend's concern about her teeth and the steps she took to address it are similar to my experience with my hair. Sometimes, it takes a small change to make a big difference in our daily routines and overall well-being.
