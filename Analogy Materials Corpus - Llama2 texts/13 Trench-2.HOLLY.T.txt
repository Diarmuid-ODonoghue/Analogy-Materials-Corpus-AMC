 A kingdom once found itself in a precarious financial situation, with its debt growing exponentially over the years. Despite warnings from its advisors to address the issue, the kingdom continued to spend beyond its means, believing that future generations would be able to pay off the debt with ease. However, as time passed, the kingdom's debt became unsustainable, and the kingdom was forced to make drastic cuts to its spending in order to pay off its creditors. These cuts had far-reaching consequences, including the reduction of social welfare programs, the scaling back of infrastructure projects, and even the sale of valuable assets. The kingdom's subjects were shocked and dismayed by the sudden changes, and many felt that the kingdom had been irresponsible in allowing its debt to grow so large. Despite the kingdom's best efforts to recover, the consequences of its procrastination were felt for generations to come. In this new story, the kingdom represents a country that has allowed its public debt to grow too big, with the consequence that later payment entails more drastic cuts than would have been required otherwise. Just as the kingdom's subjects suffered the consequences of the kingdom's actions, a country that ignores its public debt may face similar consequences in the future.
