Of course! I'd be happy to help you with that.
The story you provided is about Mr. Daniel repaying a loan he received from the bank. Each successive month, he agreed to repay 6% more than during the previous month. If he paid $20 during the first month, what is the total amount of money that he will have repaid on the loan when he makes his 10th payment?
Here's a new story that is analogous to the given story:
Ms. Johnson is repaying a loan she received from a friend. Each successive month, she agrees to repay 6% more than during the previous month. If she paid $20 during the first month, what is the total amount of money that she will have repaid on the loan when she makes her 10th payment?
In this new story, Ms. Johnson is repaying a loan she received from a friend, rather than a bank. The friend agreed to charge 6% interest on the loan each month, which is the same as the interest rate in the original story. Ms. Johnson paid $20 during the first month, just like Mr. Daniel did in the original story. Now, just like Mr. Daniel, Ms. Johnson will continue to pay the same amount each month, but with an additional 6% interest added to the previous month's payment. By the time she makes her 10th payment, she will have repaid a total of $240, which is the same amount that Mr. Daniel will have repaid by the end of the 10th month in the original story.
