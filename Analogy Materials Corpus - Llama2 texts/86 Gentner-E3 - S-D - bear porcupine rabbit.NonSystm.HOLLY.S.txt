Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's a new story that is analogous to the given story:
There once was a very fast cheetah who was friends with a sloth. One day the cheetah went away on a trip and the sloth had no one to play with. But then a kangaroo came to visit the sloth. He brought a skateboard along and said, "Would you like to race me on my skateboard?". The sloth said "Yes." The kangaroo and the sloth had a great time racing each other on the kangaroo's skateboard. When the cheetah come back and found the sloth racing with someone else he got very angry. He shouted, "I'll never race with you again!" The cheetah was so angry that he jumped onto the kangaroo's skateboard. But the skateboard began to move faster and faster down a steep hill. The cheetah was very scared. The kangaroo jumped up and chased after the skateboard so the cheetah wouldn't crash. The kangaroo stopped the runaway skateboard and saved the cheetah's life.
I hope you like this new story! Let me know if you have any other questions.
