 Once upon a time, there was a very possessive cat who was best friends with a rabbit. The cat would often say to the rabbit, "You can't play with anyone else but me." One day, the cat went on a trip and left the rabbit alone. But then a bird came to visit the rabbit. The bird brought a ball along and said, "Would you like to play catch with me?" The rabbit was excited and said "Yes." The bird and the rabbit had a great time playing catch together. When the cat came back and found the rabbit playing with someone else, he got very angry. He hissed, "I'll never play with you again!" The cat was so angry that he jumped at the bird, but the bird flew away quickly. The cat was left alone and realized that being possessive only got him into trouble. It is better to have two friends instead of one.
