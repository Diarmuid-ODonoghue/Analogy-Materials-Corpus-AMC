Certainly! Here's a new story that is analogous to the given story:
A group of five hikers got stranded in a remote canyon during a severe storm. They were in desperate need of rescue, but the canyon was home to a pack of wolves that were attracted to the group's scent. The only way to rescue them was with a team of five experienced climbers, but the wolves posed a significant threat to the rescue team's safety.
In this new story, the situation is similar to the original in that a group of people are in need of rescue, but there is a risk factor involved due to the presence of a predator (in this case, wolves) that could pose a threat to the rescue team. The story provides a new setting and scenario, while maintaining the core elements of the original story.
