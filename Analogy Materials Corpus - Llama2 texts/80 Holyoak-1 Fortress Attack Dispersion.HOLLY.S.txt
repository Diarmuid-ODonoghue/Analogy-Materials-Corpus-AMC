Certainly! Here's a new story that is analogous to the given story:
A small planet was under the iron rule of a powerful alien overlord. The overlord's fortress was situated in the center of the planet, surrounded by lush forests and bustling cities. Many energy beams radiated outward from the fortress like spokes on a wheel. A brave space explorer arose who vowed to capture the fortress and free the planet of the overlord. The explorer knew that if his entire fleet could attack the fortress at once, it could be captured. His ships were poised at the edge of the planet, ready to invade. However, a traitorous ally brought the explorer a disturbing report. The ruthless overlord had planted energy shields on each of the energy beams leading to the fortress. The shields were set so that small vessels could pass through them safely, since the overlord needed to be able to move troops and supplies to and from the fortress. However, any large fleet would detonate the shields. Not only would this destroy the ships and render the invasion impossible, but the overlord would then destroy entire star systems in retaliation. A full-scale direct attack on the fortress therefore appeared impossible. The explorer, however, was undaunted. He divided his fleet into small squadrons and dispatched each squadron to a different energy beam. When all was ready, he gave the signal, and each squadron charged through the energy beam. All of the small squadrons passed safely through the shields, and the entire fleet then attacked the fortress in full strength. In this way, the explorer was able to capture the fortress and overthrow the overlord.
