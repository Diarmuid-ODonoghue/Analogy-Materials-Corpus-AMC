 Once upon a time, there was a very possessive cat who was best friends with a rabbit. The cat would often say to the rabbit, "You can't play with anyone else but me." One day, the cat went on a trip and the rabbit had no one to play with. But then a fox came to visit the rabbit. The fox brought a ball along and said, "Would you like to play catch with me and my ball?" The rabbit said "Yes." The fox and the rabbit had a great time playing catch together. When the cat came back and found the rabbit playing with someone else, he got very angry. He shouted, "I'll never play with you again!" The cat was so angry that he jumped into the fox's ball. But the ball began to roll faster and faster down a steep hill. The cat was very scared. The fox jumped up and chased after the ball so the cat wouldn't crash. The fox stopped the runaway ball and saved the cat's life. In the end, the cat realized that being possessive only got him into trouble. It is better to have two friends instead of one.
