 Two small countries, Nova and Terra, were adjacent to a large, powerful country called Astra. Nova decided to make the best of the situation by taking over Terra. Terra started looking for aid from other strong countries, but Nova soon succeeded in taking it over. Then victorious Nova proposed to make a treaty with its powerful neighbor Astra. Nova proposed to give Astra control over Terra in exchange for a guarantee that Nova would remain independent. Astra responded by overrunning both Nova and Terra. Nova was so busy maintaining control of Terra, it could do nothing to stop Astra. Thereupon Astra installed puppet governments in both Nova and Terra and took over the newspapers and radio stations. In this new story, Nova and Terra are similar to Bolon and Salam, respectively. They are small countries that are adjacent to a powerful neighbor, Astra. Nova, like Bolon, decides to take over Terra, and Terra, like Salam, looks for aid from other strong countries. However, Nova is able to succeed in taking over Terra, and then proposes a treaty with Astra. Nova offers to give Astra control over Terra in exchange for independence, but Astra responds by overrunning both Nova and Terra. Just like in the original story, Nova is unable to stop Astra, and Astra installs puppet governments in both Nova and Terra, taking control of the newspapers and radio stations.
