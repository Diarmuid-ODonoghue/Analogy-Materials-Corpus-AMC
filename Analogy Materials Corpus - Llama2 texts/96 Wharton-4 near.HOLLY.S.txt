Of course! Here's a new story that is analogous to the given story:
After several confrontations with the editor-in-chief of the newspaper, Emily Chen, Sarah sent her portfolio around. Emily thought that Sarah was the best journalist they employed. Sarah decided to work at a competing newspaper. However, the competing newspaper never rewarded good writers because it didn't believe in giving bonuses. Emily immediately proposed giving Sarah a substantial raise when she realized what was occurring. Around then, she was wondering if she would welcome her back.
In this new story, the character Sarah is a journalist instead of a graphic designer, and the newspaper she works for is competing with another newspaper. The situation is similar to the original story in that Sarah decides to work for a competing newspaper after several confrontations with the editor-in-chief, Emily. However, the competing newspaper does not reward good writers with bonuses, which leads Emily to propose a substantial raise for Sarah when she realizes what is happening. Sarah is left wondering if Emily will welcome her back.
