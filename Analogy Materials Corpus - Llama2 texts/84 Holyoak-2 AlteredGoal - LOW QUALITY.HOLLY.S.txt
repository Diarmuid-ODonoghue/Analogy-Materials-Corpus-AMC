Certainly! Here's a new story that is analogous to the given story:
Once upon a time, there lived a magical dragon. He was a very old, wise, and rich dragon indeed. One day while he was hoarding his treasure, an old friend came up. The dragon and his friend had lived together long ago. They talked about how much fun it had been to breathe fire and fly together. The dragon's friend said, "I'm looking for a new cave right now." The dragon said, "Let's find a cave big enough for both of us. Then we can breathe fire and fly together again." They began searching far and wide for a bigger cave. They searched and they searched. Finally, they found the perfect home, a cave that was big enough for both of them. The dragon was very excited. He wanted to move all his treasure right away so he and his friend could settle in. But the cave was very far away and the dragon had many precious gems to move. It would be a lot easier for the dragon to move if his new home was closer to his old one. Now the dragon had a problem. "How could he get his new cave up close to his old cave?" After thinking a bit, the dragon came up with a wonderful idea. He began searching for his magic scales, or wings. He then commanded his scales to stretch themselves from his old home to their new home. Next, the dragon tugged and pulled on his magical scales until at last he pulled the new cave right up next to his old cave. Then the dragon was happy. He could move in no time at all. He gathered up his gems in his old home and dropped them carefully into their new home right next to him. Then the dragon said to his friend, "What a wonderful home! Now we can breathe fire and fly together every day." The dragon's friend just smiled and smiled. I'm sure you can still find the two of them sitting in their bigger cave breathing fire and flying together even today!
