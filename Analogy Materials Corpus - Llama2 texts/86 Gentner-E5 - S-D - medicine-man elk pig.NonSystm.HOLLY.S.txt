Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's a new story that is analogous to the given story:
There once was a very skilled surfer who was friends with a dolphin. One day the surfer went on a surfing trip and the dolphin had no one to play with. But then a seagull came to visit the dolphin. He brought a surfboard along and said, "Would you like to play with me and my surfboard?". The dolphin said "Yes." The seagull and the dolphin had a great time surfing together. When the surfer come back and found the dolphin playing with someone else he got very angry. He shouted, "I'll never surf with you again!" The surfer was so angry that he jumped into the seagull's surfboard. But the surfboard began to move faster down a steep wave. The surfer was very scared. The seagull jumped up and chased after the surfboard so the surfer wouldn't crash. The seagull stopped the runaway surfboard and saved the surfer's life.
In this new story, the surfer is replaced by a dolphin, and the pig is replaced by a seagull. The medicine-man is still angry when he finds the dolphin playing with someone else, but instead of jumping into the pig's wagon, he jumps into the seagull's surfboard. The seagull then chases after the surfboard to save the dolphin's life, just like the pig chased after the wagon to save the elk's life in the original story.
