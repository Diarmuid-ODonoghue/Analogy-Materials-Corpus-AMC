Certainly! Here's a new story that is analogous to the given story:
A group of scientists were trying to create a new form of renewable energy that could power entire cities. They had developed a revolutionary technology that used a type of beam to harness the power of the sun and convert it into electricity. However, the beam was so powerful that it was difficult to control and could potentially destroy entire buildings if not used carefully.
To overcome this challenge, the scientists divided the beam into a number of smaller, less powerful beams that could be directed towards specific areas of the city. By using these beams simultaneously from different angles, they were able to create a powerful and efficient energy grid that could power the entire city without any risk of destruction.
Just like the general in the original story, the scientists were able to overcome their challenge by dividing their powerful beam into smaller, more manageable parts. By using these parts in a coordinated manner, they were able to achieve their goal of creating a new form of renewable energy that was both powerful and safe.
