Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's a new story that is analogous to the given story:
The English Literature department at the local university has a diverse mix of faculty, with some professors specializing in the works of Shakespeare and others focusing on contemporary poetry. Despite their different areas of expertise, the faculty members are united in their commitment to social justice and activism. In recent years, the department has organized several events and conferences focused on issues such as diversity, equity, and inclusion in literature.
One of the professors, Dr. Emma Thompson, is particularly passionate about these issues and has been known to incorporate them into her teaching. She encourages her students to engage with these topics through their coursework and to speak out on social and political issues. As a result, many of her students have become involved in activism and have even testified before Congress on issues related to literature and social justice.
Dr. Thompson's colleague, Dr. John Milton, has a different area of expertise, but he too is committed to social activism. He has written extensively on the role of literature in shaping cultural attitudes towards issues such as race, gender, and sexuality. Despite their differences, both Dr. Thompson and Dr. Milton are well-respected within the department and have been recognized for their contributions to the field of English Literature.
Overall, the English Literature department at the local university is a vibrant and diverse community of scholars who are committed to using their knowledge and expertise to make a positive impact on the world.
