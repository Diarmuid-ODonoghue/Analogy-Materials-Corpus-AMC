Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's a new story that is analogous to the given story:
There once was a very quick rabbit who was friends with a sailor. One day the rabbit went on a trip and the sailor had no one to play with. But then a dolphin came to visit the sailor. He brought a boat along and said, "Would you like to play with me and my boat?". The sailor said "Yes." The dolphin and the sailor had a great time racing each other in the dolphin's boat. When the rabbit come back and found the sailor playing with someone else he got very angry. He shouted, "I'll never play with you again!" The rabbit was so angry that he jumped into the dolphin's boat. But the boat began to sail faster and faster. The rabbit was very scared. The dolphin jumped up and chased after the boat so the rabbit wouldn't fall into the water. The dolphin stopped the runaway boat and saved the rabbit's life.
