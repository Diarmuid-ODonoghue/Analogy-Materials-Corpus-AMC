Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's a new story that is analogous to the given story:
Once upon a time, there was a very possessive snake who was best friends with a flamingo. The snake would often tell the flamingo, "You can't play with anyone else but me." One day, the snake went on a trip and the flamingo had no one to dance with. But then a butterfly came to visit the flamingo. The butterfly brought a pair of wings and said, "Would you like to dance with me and my wings?" The flamingo said "Yes." The butterfly and the flamingo had a wonderful time dancing together. When the snake returned and found the flamingo dancing with someone else, he got very angry. He shouted, "I'll never dance with you again!" The snake was so angry that he slithered into the butterfly's wings. But the wings began to flutter faster and faster, and the snake was very scared. The butterfly jumped up and chased after the wings so the snake wouldn't fall. The butterfly stopped the fluttering wings and saved the snake's life. In the end, the snake realized that being possessive only gets him into trouble. It is better to have two friends instead of one.
