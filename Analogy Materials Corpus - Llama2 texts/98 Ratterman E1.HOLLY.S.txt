Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's a new story that is analogous to the given story:
Maria was a student at a special needs school who was confined indoors almost all the time. She could never pass the monthly classroom inspections so she hated them. She spent most of her time daydreaming about adventures. A few days before the April inspection Maria's classroom was still a mess since she had done nothing but daydream. To provide Maria with an incentive, the teacher promised her a trip to the local amusement park if she cleaned her classroom and put it in order once and for all. Maria was overjoyed. But there was no longer enough time for her to put it in order. As a result, she did not pass the inspection and did not get her trip to the amusement park. Maria sulked all day and slammed her door so hard the wall cracked, but she still didn't get her trip.
In this new story, Maria is a student at a special needs school who is confined indoors almost all the time. She daydreams about adventures instead of food like William did in the original story. The teacher promises Maria a trip to the local amusement park if she cleans her classroom and puts it in order, just like the nurse promised William gingerbread. However, just like in the original story, Maria does not have enough time to clean her classroom and as a result, she does not pass the inspection and does not get her trip to the amusement park. Maria sulks and slams her door, just like William did in the original story.
