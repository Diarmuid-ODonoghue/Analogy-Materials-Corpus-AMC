 Rocket Company was a small business that specialized in building and launching rockets. One year, Rocket Company decided to expand its operations by entering the market for satellite manufacturing. However, Rocket Company realized that to be competitive in this market, they would need to invest in state-of-the-art facilities and technology. So, they poured all of their resources into building a cutting-edge satellite factory. Unfortunately, Rocket Company didn't realize the financial risks involved in satellite manufacturing, and within six months, they had spent more than they could afford. Their stock prices plummeted, and they were forced to abandon their satellite project and return to their core business of building rockets. In this new story, Rocket Company is similar to Quiggly Company in that they both made a risky investment in a new market in order to stay competitive. However, Rocket Company's mistake was not recognizing the financial risks involved in satellite manufacturing, whereas Quiggly Company's mistake was not realizing the financial risks involved in space manufacturing.
