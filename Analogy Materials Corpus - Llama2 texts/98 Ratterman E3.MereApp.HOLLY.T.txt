 Mere-Appearance Match: The Wealthy Businesswoman's Dilemma Melissa was a successful entrepreneur who prided herself on her punctuality and attention to detail. She had two chauffeurs on staff, one for each of her luxurious cars, and she liked to boast to her colleagues that with her two drivers, she could always be on time for her meetings. One day, Melissa was in a rush to get to a crucial business meeting, but when she went to the first chauffeur, she found him snoozing in the back seat of her car. Thinking it was his day off, the chauffeur didn't even bother to wake up. Melissa was furious and quickly called the second chauffeur, but he had already left for the day, assuming that the first chauffeur was covering his shift. As a result, Melissa ended up running late for her meeting, which could have cost her a valuable deal. She realized that she couldn't always rely on her chauffeurs to be available and punctual, and she began to reconsider her reliance on them. In this new story, the wealthy businesswoman, Melissa, is the protagonist who finds herself in a similar predicament as Alexander in the original story. Both characters are wealthy and employ multiple drivers, but they both end up missing important meetings due to the drivers' lack of availability and punctuality. The story highlights the importance of having reliable and responsible staff, and the consequences of relying too heavily on them.
