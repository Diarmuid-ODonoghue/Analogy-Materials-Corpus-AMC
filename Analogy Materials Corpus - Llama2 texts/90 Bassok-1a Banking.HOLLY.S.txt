Of course! I'd be happy to help you with that.
The story you provided is similar to the following new story:
A young entrepreneur, Sarah, invests $10,000 in a promising startup in its early stages. Each year, the startup experiences rapid growth, with its value increasing by 1.3 times its value from the previous year. After 12 years, Sarah's initial investment has grown to a substantial sum, providing her with a handsome return on her investment.
In both stories, the investment grows at a consistent rate over time, with each year's growth building upon the previous year's. This creates a compounding effect that leads to significant increases in value over time.
To determine the value of Sarah's investment after 12 years, we can use the same formula as in the original story:
Value of investment after 12 years = Value of investment after 11 years x 1.3
Using the formula, we can calculate the value of Sarah's investment after 12 years as follows:
Value of investment after 12 years = $10,000 x 1.3^12 = $10,000 x 16.7 = $167,000
Therefore, Sarah's initial investment of $10,000 grows to $167,000 after 12 years, providing her with a return on investment of $157,000.
I hope this new story is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.
