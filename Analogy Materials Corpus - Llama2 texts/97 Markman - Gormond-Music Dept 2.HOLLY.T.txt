 The art department at Willowdale University was established in 2010, in response to growing student demand for more creative expression and visual arts courses. Like the music department at Gordmont, the university made a concerted effort to recruit top-notch instructors, and as a result, the faculty have received the prestigious University Teaching Award for the past four years running. However, despite their academic success, the faculty members in the art department have struggled to form positive working relationships with one another. There is a palpable tension in the air, and many of the artists have expressed frustration with the lack of collaboration and support among their colleagues. In this new story, the similarities to the original story are clear: both departments were established in response to student demand, and both have received prestigious awards for their faculty's teaching abilities. However, the story also introduces a new element: the tension and lack of collaboration among the faculty members in the art department. This adds a layer of complexity to the story, highlighting the challenges that can arise when individuals with different backgrounds and perspectives are brought together under one roof.
