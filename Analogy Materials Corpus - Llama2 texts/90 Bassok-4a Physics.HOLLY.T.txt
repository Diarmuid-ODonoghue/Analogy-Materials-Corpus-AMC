To find the height of the helicopter above the ground, we can use the information given in the problem: 1. The object takes 10 seconds to reach the ground. 2. The initial speed of the object at the beginning of the 1st second is 0 m/s. 3. The speed of the object increases uniformly by 4.2 m/s each successive second. From these three pieces of information, we can set up a simple equation to solve for the height of the helicopter: Let t be the time in seconds that the object takes to reach the ground. Let v be the velocity of the object at time t. We know that the initial velocity of the object is 0 m/s, so v = 0 at time t = 0. We also know that the velocity of the object increases by 4.2 m/s each second, so: v = 4.2 m/s at time t = 1 second v = 8.4 m/s at time t = 2 seconds v = 12.6 m/s at time t = 3 seconds v = ... (you can continue this pattern to find the velocity at any time t). Now, we can use the equation: distance = velocity x time to find the distance traveled by the object: distance = 4.2 m/s x 10 seconds = 42 meters So, the height of the helicopter above the ground is: height = distance / time = 42 meters / 10 seconds = 4.2 meters Therefore, the height of the helicopter above the ground is approximately 4.2 meters.
