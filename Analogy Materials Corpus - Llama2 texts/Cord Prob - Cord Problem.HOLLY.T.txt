 Suppose you are on a deserted island, and you find yourself in a predicament where you have two vines that are hanging from the trees on opposite sides of the beach. The vines are of such a length that when you hold one vine in either hand, you cannot reach the other. Your task is to tie the ends of these vines together to create a longer vine that you can use to climb back to the mainland. To help you in this task, you may use any of the objects listed below, which are also found on the island: rocks, shells, driftwood, coconuts, sand. Just like in the original story, you must use the objects available to you in the room (or on the island) to solve the problem and tie the ends of the cords (or vines) together. Good luck!
