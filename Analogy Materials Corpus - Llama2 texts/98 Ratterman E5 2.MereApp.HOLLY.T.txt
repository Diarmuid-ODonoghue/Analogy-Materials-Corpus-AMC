 Mere-Appearance Match: Leila was a young woman with a Moroccan last name. Leila lived in Hawaii and had very light skin because she spent a great deal of time in the sun. Leila had a job at a surf shop and constantly saw people who had overdone it and gotten terrible sunburns. They were always embarrassed about being so silly. But Leila never had any problems. In fact, she would spend whole weekends surfing on the North Shore.
