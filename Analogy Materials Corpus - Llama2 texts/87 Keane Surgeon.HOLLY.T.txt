 A botanist was trying to save a rare and endangered species of plant that was located in a remote and inaccessible region of the forest. The plant was being threatened by a deadly fungus that was spreading rapidly and could destroy the entire population if left unchecked. The botanist knew that the only way to save the plant was to use a specialized fungicide that could reach the affected areas without harming the rest of the forest. However, the fungicide was too powerful for the surrounding plants, and could destroy them if used at too high an intensity. After careful consideration, the botanist came up with a solution. She divided the fungicide into smaller batches, and applied them from multiple directions at once, creating a concentrated but controlled amount that could reach the affected area without harming the surrounding plants. With this approach, the botanist was able to save the endangered species of plant and preserve the delicate balance of the forest ecosystem.
