Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's a new story that is analogous to the given story:
There once was a very fast cheetah who was friends with a giraffe. One day the cheetah went away on a trip and the giraffe had no one to race with. But then a zebra came to visit the giraffe. He brought a sled along and said, "Would you like to race with me and my sled?". The giraffe said "Yes." The zebra and the giraffe had a great time racing each other on the zebra's sled. When the cheetah come back and found the giraffe racing with someone else he got very angry. He shouted, "I'll never race with you again!" The cheetah was so angry that he jumped into the zebra's sled. But the sled began to speed down a steep hill. The cheetah was very scared. The zebra jumped up and chased after the sled so the cheetah wouldn't crash. The zebra stopped the runaway sled and saved the cheetah's life.
I hope you like this new story! Let me know if you have any other questions.
