 A robin named Rachel spent the entire spring and summer singing beautiful melodies in the trees. When autumn arrived, she paid a visit to a squirrel named Squeaky. However, Squeaky was not impressed with Rachel's singing. "You have been singing all spring and summer while I have been busy collecting nuts for the winter," he said. Rachel tried to impress Squeaky by singing a special song, but he was still not pleased. "I don't have time for your singing, I have more important things to worry about," he said.
