Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's a new story that is analogous to the given story:
The faculty in the Economics department at the University of Atlantic have been working tirelessly to secure research grants, which have allowed them to hire research assistants for each member of the faculty. As a result, the Economics department has become the most well-funded department at the university, enabling the faculty to pursue high-level research projects without sacrificing their teaching duties. The undergraduate students have consistently rated the faculty in this department as the best teachers on campus, and their reputation has spread throughout the university, resulting in overcrowded courses and long waitlists for popular classes. Despite the challenges of managing such high demand, the faculty in the Economics department remain committed to providing the highest quality education to their students.
