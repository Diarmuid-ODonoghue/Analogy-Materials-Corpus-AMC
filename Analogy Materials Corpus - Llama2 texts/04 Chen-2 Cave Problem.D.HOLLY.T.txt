 Great! Here are some suggestions for the treasure hunter to avoid getting lost in the cave: 1. Leave a mark: The treasure hunter could leave a mark at the entrance of the cave, such as a small stone or a piece of cloth, so that he can easily find his way back out. 2. Create a landmark: The treasure hunter could create a landmark inside the cave, such as a small pile of rocks or a unique formation, that he can use to navigate back to the entrance. 3. Use the flashlight beam: The treasure hunter could use his flashlight to create a beam of light on the walls of the cave, which can help him navigate and find his way back out. 4.
