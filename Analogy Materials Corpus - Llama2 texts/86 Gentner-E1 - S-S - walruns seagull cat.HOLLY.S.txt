Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's a new story that is analogous to the given story:
There once was a very possessive tiger who was friends with a rabbit. The tiger often said to the rabbit, "Don't ever play with anyone else but me." One day the tiger went away on a trip and the rabbit had no one to play with. But then a fox-came to visit the rabbit. He brought a ball along and said, "Would you like to play catch with me?" The rabbit said "Yes." The fox-and the rabbit had a great time playing catch together. When the tiger come back and found the rabbit playing with someone else he got very angry. He shouted, "I'll never play with you again!" The tiger was so angry that he jumped into the fox's den. But the den began to collapse and the tiger was trapped. The fox-jumped up and chased after the tiger so he wouldn't get hurt. The fox-stopped the tiger from getting hurt and saved his life. In the end, the tiger realized that being possessive only got him into trouble. It is better to have two friends instead of one.
