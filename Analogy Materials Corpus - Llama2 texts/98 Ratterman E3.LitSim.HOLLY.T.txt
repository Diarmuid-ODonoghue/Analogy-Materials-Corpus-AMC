 Melissa was a successful businesswoman who prided herself on being punctual and organized. She had a chauffeur who drove her luxurious car to all of her meetings, and she always made sure to give him a generous tip for his services. However, one day when she was in a rush to get to an important meeting, she realized that her chauffeur was nowhere to be found. She searched the house and finally found him taking a nap in his quarters. He had assumed it was his day off and had forgotten about her appointment. Melissa was furious and decided to hire a second chauffeur to ensure that she would never be late again.
