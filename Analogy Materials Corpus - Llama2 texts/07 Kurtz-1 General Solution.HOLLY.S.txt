Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's a new story that is analogous to the given story:
A small planet was ruled from a powerful space station by a tyrannical alien emperor. The space station was situated in the middle of the planet, surrounded by colonies and spaceports. Many hyperspace routes led to the space station through the galaxy. A rebel leader vowed to capture the space station. The leader knew that an attack by his entire fleet would capture the space station. He gathered his fleet at the edge of one of the hyperspace routes, ready to launch a full-scale direct attack. However, the leader then learned that the emperor had planted traps on each of the hyperspace routes. The traps were set so that small ships could pass over them safely, since the emperor needed to move his own troops and supplies to and from the space station. However, any large fleet would trigger the traps. Not only would this destroy the fleet, but it would also damage many neighboring colonies and spaceports. It seemed impossible to capture the space station. However, the leader devised a simple plan. He divided his fleet into small groups and dispatched each group to the edge of a different hyperspace route. When all was ready, he gave the signal and each group jumped into hyperspace, heading towards the space station. Each group continued on its route, so that the entire fleet arrived together at the space station at the same time. In this way, the leader captured the space station and overthrew the emperor.
