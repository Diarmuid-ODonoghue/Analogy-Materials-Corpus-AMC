Certainly! Here's a new story that is analogous to the given story:
A farmer and his wife were very poor and could not afford to feed themselves and their two small children, Jack and Jill. As a solution, the wife suggested that they lead the children out into the vast fields and leave them there. So the next day they took them out to the fields to tend to the crops. Jack, with his pockets full of seeds, dropped one at regular intervals to mark a path back home. Later, while the children napped, the parents returned home without them. That night, Jack followed the trail of seeds that he had left behind all the way home. When they arrived home, the parents acted happy at their return but immediately planned to take them back out to the fields again the next day. Jack, aware of the plan, wanted to go outside that night to plant more seeds. However, the wife locked both of the children in their room before he could do so. The next morning, she gave both children a piece of bread for lunch. Instead of saving the bread to eat, Jack tore pieces off and left them on the trail to mark the way home.
