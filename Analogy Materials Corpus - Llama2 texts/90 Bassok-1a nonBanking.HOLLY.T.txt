 Of course! I'd be happy to help you with that. Based on the information provided in the story, we can see that the craft show's popularity is increasing at a steady rate. Each year, the number of people attending the show increases by a factor of 1.3. To find out how many people came to the craft show during its 12th year, we can use the formula: Number of people in 12th year = Number of people in 1st year x 1.3^11 Plugging in the values we know, we get: Number of people in 12th year = 1,000 x 1.3^11 Simplifying and solving for the answer, we get: Number of people in 12th year = 1,000 x 1.3^11 = 90,000 Therefore, during its 12th year, the craft show attracted 90,000 people.
