Title: The Paper Roll Predicament
As the team at InkTech worked on their latest business machine, they encountered a peculiar problem. The paper roll, which was designed to supply a continuous stream of paper to the machine, was having trouble delivering its full capacity. No matter how much paper they fed into the machine, the roll seemed to run out too quickly, leaving the team scrambling to refill it.
After conducting a series of experiments, the team discovered that the issue was caused by the small diameter of the paper roll. When the roll was full, the paper band inside curved and tended to reenter the inlet opening, preventing the machine from functioning properly.
To solve the problem, the team developed a closure means mounted on the carrier of the paper roll. When the carrier was displaced due to the reduction in the diameter of the paper roll, the closure means substantially closed the inlet opening, allowing the paper band to flow smoothly through the machine.
Thanks to this innovative solution, the team at InkTech was able to overcome the paper roll predicament and deliver their business machine to market with flying colors.
