 Maria was thrilled when she landed an interview for a customer service representative at a popular tech company in the city. She had been job hunting for months and this seemed like the perfect opportunity. Maria spent hours researching the company and practicing her interview answers, determined to make a good impression. The next day, she received a call from the hiring manager offering her the job. Maria was over the moon, but then she realized she had made a mistake. She had spent all of her savings on a new wardrobe to impress the interviewer, and now she had nothing left for the first month of work. Maria was dismayed and didn't know what to do. She had been so sure she was going to get the job and now she was left with nothing. She thought about reaching out to her friends and family for help, but she was too proud. She didn't want to burden them with her problems. As she sat in her small apartment, staring at her empty bank account, Maria couldn't help but feel like she had made a huge mistake. She had let her excitement get the best of her and now she was paying the price. She vowed to be more careful in the future, but for now, she could only hope that something would come along to help her get back on her feet.
