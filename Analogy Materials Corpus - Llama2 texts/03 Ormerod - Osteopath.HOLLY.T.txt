 After years of research, a brilliant scientist in Tokyo has discovered a revolutionary new technology that could potentially cure cancer. The scientist theorizes that by using a specialized device that can emit a high-frequency electromagnetic field, cancer cells can be selectively targeted and destroyed without harming healthy cells. However, the scientist faces a major obstacle: the device requires a tremendous amount of energy to operate, and the scientist lacks the physical strength to build the device on her own. The suggestion is for the scientist to seek out a team of skilled engineers and technicians to help her develop and build the device. In this new story, the main character (the scientist) has discovered a groundbreaking technology that could potentially save countless lives. However, she is unable to bring her discovery to fruition due to a lack of resources or expertise. The story follows her journey as she seeks out the help she needs to overcome this obstacle and bring her innovation to the world. I hope this new story is helpful!
