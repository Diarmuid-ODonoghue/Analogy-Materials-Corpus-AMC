Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's a new story that is analogous to the given story:
In a chemistry lab at a prestigious university, a very expensive reaction vessel was being used in some experiments. Emily was the research assistant responsible for operating the vessel. One morning she came into the lab and found to her dismay that the vessel was empty. She realized that she had forgotten to add the reactants the previous night. As a result, the reaction had not occurred, and the vessel was now empty. Emily knew that the reaction could be restarted if a small amount of the reactants could be added to the vessel. However, the reactants were extremely sensitive to temperature and humidity, and any attempt to add them would result in a violent reaction. Furthermore, the lab did not have any spare vessels, and replacing the reaction vessel would be too costly. Emily was about to give up when she had an idea. She placed several small containers of the reactants in a circle around the reaction vessel, and administered low-intensity heat and humidity from several directions all at once. The combined effect was enough to stabilize the reactants, and Emily was able to successfully add them to the vessel without any violent reactions. The reaction proceeded as expected, and Emily was able to complete the experiment.
