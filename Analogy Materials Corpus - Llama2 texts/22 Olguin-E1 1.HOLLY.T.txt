 A few years ago, I was supposed to meet a colleague for lunch at a popular restaurant in the city. I had planned to leave my office at 12:30 PM sharp, but unfortunately, I got stuck in a meeting that ran longer than expected. By the time I finally emerged from the meeting room, it was already 1:15 PM, and I realized that I was going to be late to meet my colleague. I rushed to the restaurant, but by the time I arrived, my colleague had already finished their lunch and was about to leave. I apologized profusely for my lateness and explained the circumstances that led to it. Although my colleague was understanding and gracious, I could tell that they were inconvenienced by my unpunctuality. In both your friend's situation and mine, there was a lack of planning and foresight that led to unpunctuality. In both cases, the individuals involved were busy with other tasks and didn't leave enough time to arrive at their destination on time. I hope this anecdote helps illustrate the concept of unpunctuality and how it can impact our plans and relationships with others.
