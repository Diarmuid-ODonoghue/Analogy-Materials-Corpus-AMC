 In a small town nestled in the mountains, the elder of a remote tribe had the sacred duty of maintaining the tribe's ancient talisman. Every year, the elder would embark on a treacherous journey to the neighboring village to collect offerings. To determine the amount of offerings, the elder would consult the talisman's weight in precious gems. His method of measuring this amount was to place the talisman in a small pouch at one end of a delicate balance scale and hang the other end of the scale from a nearby tree branch. This tree branch was adorned with small bags of precious gems until the scale balanced the weight of the talisman. Unfortunately, during the elder's most recent journey, the balance scale was lost in a sudden storm. Now the elder faces a daunting challenge: How can he determine the appropriate amount of offerings without the benefit of a balance scale, a pulley system, or a conventional scale?
