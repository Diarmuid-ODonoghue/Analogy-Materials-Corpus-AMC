 Mere-Appearance Match. Maria was a woman from Brazil who was vacationing in Australia. She wanted to impress her friends with a golden glow, so one day she went out to spend the afternoon at the beach. But a fellow vacationer acquaintance chanced to pass by and gave Maria a friendly warning. If Maria stayed in the sun too long, she would risk getting a severe sunburn and would need medication. Maria was so annoyed at having to remain so pale when everyone else was golden that she decided to go back to Brazil. New Mere-Appearance Match. Maria was a young woman with a Brazilian last name. Maria lived in the United States and had very light skin because she spent a great deal of time indoors. Maria had a job in an office and constantly saw people who had overdone it and gotten pale.
