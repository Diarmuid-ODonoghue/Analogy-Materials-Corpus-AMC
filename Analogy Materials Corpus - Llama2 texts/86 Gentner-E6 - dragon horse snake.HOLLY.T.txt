 Once upon a time, there was a very possessive cat who was best friends with a bird. The cat would often say to the bird, "You can't play with anyone else but me." One day, the cat went on a trip and the bird had no one to play with. But then a squirrel came to visit the bird. He brought a toy acorn along and said, "Would you like to play with me and my acorn?". The bird said "Yes." The squirrel and the bird had a great time playing together with the acorn. When the cat came back and found the bird playing with someone else, he got very angry. He shouted, "I'll never play with you again!" The cat was so angry that he jumped into the squirrel's nest. But the nest began to sway in the wind and the cat was very scared. The squirrel jumped up and chased after the cat so he wouldn't fall out of the nest. The squirrel stopped the cat from falling and saved his life. In the end, the cat realized that being possessive only got him into trouble. It is better to have two friends instead of one.
