 In a cutting-edge tech startup, a revolutionary new device was being tested in a controlled environment. The device, a small, sleek box with a glowing screen, was capable of generating precise amounts of energy. The team of engineers responsible for the device had been working tirelessly to perfect its functionality, and they were on the brink of a major breakthrough. However, when they arrived at the lab the next morning, they found that the device had stopped working. Upon further inspection, they discovered that the device had overheated during the night, causing the delicate circuitry inside to malfunction. The team realized that they had forgotten to turn off the device the previous evening, and now it was beyond repair. The damage was too extensive, and the device could not be fixed with a simple repair job. The team was devastated, as they had invested so much time and resources into the project. They knew they had to find a way to fix the device, but they were running out of options. How could they solve this problem and save their groundbreaking invention?
