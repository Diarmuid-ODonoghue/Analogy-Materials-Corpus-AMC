Certainly! Here's a new story that is analogous to the given story:
Once upon a time, there lived a magical dragon. He was a very old, wise, and rich dragon indeed. One day while he was hoarding his treasure, an old friend came up. The dragon told his friend, "I'm going to look for a bigger and better cave to live in. Will you help me look?" So they began searching far and wide for another cave. Finally, the dragon found the perfect home. It was larger, prettier, and not too far away from his old cave. The dragon was very excited and wanted to begin moving his treasure right away. But now the dragon had a problem. He had a great many precious gems in his old cave. He had to somehow get all the gems from his old cave to the new cave without losing or dropping a single gem. After thinking a bit, the dragon came up with a wonderful idea. He began searching for his magic breath, or fire-breathing ability. He then commanded his breath to stretch itself from his old cave to his new cave. Next, the dragon tugged and pulled on his magical breath until at last he pulled the new cave right up next to his old cave. At once, the dragon began gathering his gems together in his old cave and simply dropped them carefully into his new cave right next to him. When all his gems were safely tucked away in his new cave, the dragon settled in happily. He invited his friend to come in and admire his new home. His friend came in and said, "What a good cave for you!" I'm sure you can still find the dragon sitting in his new bigger and better cave with all his gems and smiling contentedly even today!
