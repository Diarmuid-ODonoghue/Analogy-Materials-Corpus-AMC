Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's a new story that is analogous to the given story:
The psychology department at Willow Creek University has been facing a similar challenge as the biology department at Fallsburg. With several faculty members retiring or leaving for other opportunities, the department is now understaffed and struggling to keep up with administrative tasks and advising students. Many of the remaining faculty members are also from the 1980s and 1990s, and they bring a similar activist spirit to their teaching and research. They are passionate about addressing social and environmental issues, and they often encourage their students to get involved in these causes as well. As a result, some faculty members have been called to testify before Congress on issues related to mental health and wellness.
In this new story, the department is facing a similar challenge of having too few faculty members to handle the workload, but the specific context and details are different. The department is now focused on psychology rather than biology, and the faculty members are from the 1980s and 1990s rather than the 1960s. However, the overall theme of the story remains the same, with the faculty members being passionate about their activism and advocacy work, and the department struggling to keep up with the demands of administration and advising.
