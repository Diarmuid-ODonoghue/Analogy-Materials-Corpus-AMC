 In a cutting-edge tech startup, a revolutionary new device was being tested in a controlled environment. The device, a small, sleek box with a glowing screen, was capable of generating precise amounts of energy. The team of engineers responsible for the device had been working tirelessly to perfect its functionality, and they were on the brink of a major breakthrough. However, when they arrived at the lab the next morning, they found that the device had stopped working. Upon further inspection, they discovered that the device had overheated during the night, causing the delicate circuitry inside to malfunction. The team realized that they had forgotten to turn off the device before leaving the lab, and now it was beyond repair. The only way to fix it was to use a high-intensity energy beam to fuse the broken components back together. However, the energy beam had the potential to damage the surrounding casing, rendering the device useless. The team was faced with a difficult decision: risk damaging the device to repair it, or accept the loss and start over with a new prototype. How could they solve this situation?
