 Two jars are on a shelf, one within the cat's reach and one farther away. One jar contains a number of tasty treats, and the other is empty. Also on the shelf is a long, flexible fishing pole, a small slingshot, a roll of sticky tape, a ball of twine, and a handful of catnip toys. The task is to use the materials provided to transfer the treats from the filled jar to the empty jar without leaving their seat. Can you think of a way for the cat to use the materials to achieve this goal?
