Of course! I'd be happy to help you with that.
The story you provided is about a potato farmer who gathers a certain amount of potatoes on the first day of the harvest and estimates that the amount gathered on each successive day will be 4 bushels more than the preceding day. You want to know how many bushels the farmer will collect during the 14-day harvest.
Here's a new story that is analogous to the given story:
A writer is working on a novel and estimates that they will write 500 words on the first day of writing. The writer assumes that they will write 100 words more on each successive day. If the writer continues writing for 14 days, how many words will they have written in total?
As in the original story, the writer's estimate of the number of words they will write each day is based on a constant increase of 100 words per day. Just as the farmer in the original story estimates that the amount gathered on each day will be 4 bushels more than the preceding day, the writer in the new story estimates that the number of words written each day will be 100 words more than the preceding day.
I hope this new story helps you solve the problem! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
