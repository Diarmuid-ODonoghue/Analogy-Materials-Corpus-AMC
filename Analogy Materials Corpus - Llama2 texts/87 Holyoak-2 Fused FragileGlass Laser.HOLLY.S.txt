Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's a new story that is analogous to the given story:
In a chemistry lab at a prestigious university, a very expensive reaction vessel was being used in some experiments. Emily was the research assistant responsible for operating the vessel. One morning she came into the lab and found to her dismay that the vessel was no longer working. She realized that she had forgotten to turn it off the previous night. As a result, the vessel had overheated, and a critical component inside the vessel had fused together. The surrounding vessel was completely sealed, so there was no way to open it. Emily knew that the vessel could be repaired if a brief, high-intensity ultrasound wave could be used to jar apart the fused parts. Furthermore, the lab had the necessary equipment to do the job. However, a high-intensity sonic cleaner would also damage the fragile glass surrounding the component. At lower intensities the cleaner would not break the glass, but neither would it clean the component. So it seemed that the vessel could not be repaired, and a costly replacement would be required. Emily was about to give up when she had an idea. She placed several sonic cleaners in a circle around the vessel, and administered low-intensity cleaning settings from several directions all at once. The combined effect of the cleaners was enough to clean the component. Since each spot on the surrounding glass received only a low-intensity cleaning setting from one cleaner, the glass was left intact. Emily was greatly relieved that the vessel was repaired, and she then went on to successfully complete the experiment.
