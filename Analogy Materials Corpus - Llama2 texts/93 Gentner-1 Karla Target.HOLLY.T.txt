 A wise old owl named Hoot lived in a hollow tree at the edge of a dense forest. One sunny morning, a young boy with a net and a bucket appeared at the edge of the forest, searching for birds to catch. Hoot watched from her perch as the boy scanned the trees, looking for his next catch. Hoot knew the boy wanted to add her to his collection, so she flew down to him and offered to give him a few of her feathers in exchange for his promise to never harm her or any of her fellow birds again. The boy was amazed by the owl's generosity and gratefully accepted her offer. From that day on, he left the forest and its inhabitants in peace. In this new story, the wise old owl Hoot takes the place of the hawk Karla, and the young boy with a net and a bucket replaces the hunter. Just as Karla offered her feathers to the hunter in exchange for his promise to never harm her again, Hoot offers her feathers to the boy in exchange for his promise to leave the forest and its inhabitants in peace. The story follows a similar pattern, with the bird offering something of value to the human in exchange for their protection.
