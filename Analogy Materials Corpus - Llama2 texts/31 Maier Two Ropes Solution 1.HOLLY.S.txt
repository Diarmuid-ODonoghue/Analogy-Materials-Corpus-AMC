Great! Here's a new story that is analogous to the given story:
In a vast landscape, two trees stand alone, separated by a wide distance. One tree has a small hook on its trunk, while the other has a small ring on its branches. A traveler is tasked with connecting the two trees, but there's a catch: they cannot reach both trees at once. The trees are too far apart, and the traveler must find a way to bridge the gap.
1. The traveler decides to start by attaching a long rope to the hook on the first tree. They then use the rope to pull the second tree closer, until they can reach the ring on its branches.
How do you think the traveler might solve this problem? Can you think of any other analogies that might be similar to this story?
