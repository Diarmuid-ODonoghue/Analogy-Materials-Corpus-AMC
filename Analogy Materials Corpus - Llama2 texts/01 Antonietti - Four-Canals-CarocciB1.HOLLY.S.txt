Of course! Here's a new story that is analogous to the given story:
A farmer wanted to increase crop yields on his land, so he decided to build a large irrigation system to bring water from a nearby river to his fields. However, a veterinarian pointed out that during heavy rainfall seasons, the river could overflow and damage the fields. To avoid this, the veterinarian suggested building four smaller irrigation canals instead of one large one. These smaller canals would bring water from four different tributaries of the river, ensuring that only small amounts of water flowed into each canal during heavy rainfall seasons. This would prevent dangerous overflowing, while still providing sufficient water for the fields during drought periods. The farmer agreed with the veterinarian's suggestion and implemented the plan, resulting in a successful and efficient irrigation system.
