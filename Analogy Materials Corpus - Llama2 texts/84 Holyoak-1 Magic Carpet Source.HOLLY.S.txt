Certainly! Here's a new story that is analogous to the given story:
Once upon a time, there lived a wise and powerful dragon. He was a very old, wise, and rich dragon indeed. One day while he was hoarding his treasure, he decided he would like to find an even bigger and better cave to live in. So he began searching far and wide for another cave. Finally, he found the perfect home. It was larger, prettier, and not too far away from his old cave. The dragon was very excited and began moving his treasure right away. But now the dragon had a problem. He had a great many precious gems and gold in his old cave. He had to somehow get all the treasure from his old cave to the new cave without losing or dropping a single gem or gold piece. After thinking a bit, the dragon came up with a wonderful idea. He searched for his magic breath. Then he commanded it to roll itself up into a long hollow tube. Next, the dragon commanded his breath to place one end at his old cave and the other end at his new cave so that it formed a sort of hollow bridge between the two caves. Then, the dragon very carefully took one gem from inside his old cave and placed it into the opening of his breath. At once, the gem began tumbling and rolling through the breath tube until it reached his new cave and plopped safely inside. The dragon grinned happily and began rolling all his treasure through his breath into his new cave. In fact, I'm sure you can still find him sitting in his new, bigger and better cave with all his treasure and smiling contentedly even today!
