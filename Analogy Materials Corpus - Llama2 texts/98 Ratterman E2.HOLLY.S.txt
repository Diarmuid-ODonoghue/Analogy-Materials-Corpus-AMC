Certainly! Here's a new story that is analogous to the given story:
Ms. Rodriguez was the CEO of a tech startup that specialized in developing cutting-edge smartphones. Her team had just perfected a new technology that allowed the phones to charge wirelessly, eliminating the need for tangled cords and lost charging cables. However, during a demonstration of the new technology, Ms. Rodriguez accidentally dropped her phone on the floor, causing it to shatter. Fortunately, the new wireless charging technology proved to be more resilient than expected, and the phone was able to charge without any issues.
Ms. Rodriguez was shaken by the incident, but she quickly realized the potential danger of not having a safety feature in place. She immediately instructed her team to incorporate a durable protective layer around the wireless charging coil to prevent any future accidents. Thanks to this new safety feature, Ms. Rodriguez was able to continue showcasing the innovative technology to investors and customers without any concerns.
In this new story, the main character (Ms. Rodriguez) is a CEO of a tech startup, rather than a manager of a company that makes razors (Mr. Newton). The incident that occurs is the accidental dropping of a phone, rather than cutting oneself with a new razor. However, just like in the original story, the main character is alarmed by the incident and quickly takes action to incorporate a safety feature to prevent any future accidents.
