 It was an unseasonably warm day in March, and Max the rabbit thought to himself, "This is my chance." He hopped out of his burrow and stretched his long ears, enjoying the warmth on his fur. As he hopped through the meadow, he sang a happy tune, his voice so loud and cheerful that it woke a nearby squirrel. The squirrel asked Max to sing another song, and Max was so impressed by his own talents that he forgot it was still spring and decided to go searching for flowers to decorate his burrow.
