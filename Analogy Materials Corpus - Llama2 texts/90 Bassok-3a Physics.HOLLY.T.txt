 Of course! I'd be happy to help you with that. To find the acceleration of the train, we can use the formula: acceleration = (final velocity - initial velocity) / time taken In this case, the initial velocity of the train is 15 m/s, and the final velocity is 45 m/s. The time taken is 12 seconds. So, we can plug these values into the formula to get: acceleration = (45 m/s - 15 m/s) / 12 s = 3 m/s^2 Therefore, the acceleration of the train is 3 m/s^2.
