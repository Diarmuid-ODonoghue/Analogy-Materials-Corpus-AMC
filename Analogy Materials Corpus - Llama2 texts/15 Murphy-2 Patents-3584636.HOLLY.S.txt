Title: Solar-Powered Valve Control for Hazardous Environments
Abstract: A novel valve control system that utilizes a photovoltaic cell to power a magnetic coil, which in turn operates a flapper to control fluid flow in hazardous environments. The system eliminates the need for external power sources or switching arrangements, reducing the risk of electric sparks that could ignite flammable materials. The photovoltaic cell harnesses energy from the sun to provide a reliable and sustainable power source, ensuring the safe and efficient operation of the valve control system in even the most challenging environments.
Story: In a groundbreaking innovation, a team of engineers has developed a valve control system that leverages the power of the sun to control fluid flow in hazardous environments. The system, which is protected by US Patent 3584636, features a photovoltaic cell that generates electricity to power a magnetic coil, which in turn operates a flapper to control the flow of fluids.
The innovation was born out of a need for a reliable and safe valve control system that could operate in environments where traditional power sources are not feasible or safe. The team recognized that the use of photovoltaic cells could provide a sustainable and reliable power source, eliminating the need for external power sources or switching arrangements that could pose a risk of electric sparks.
The system consists of a photovoltaic cell that is connected to a magnetic coil, which in turn operates a flapper that controls the flow of fluids. The flapper is designed to alternately open and close fluidic back pressure orifices, allowing for precise control of fluid flow. The system is designed to be compact and lightweight, making it easy to install and maintain in a variety of environments.
The team has tested the system in a variety of hazardous environments, including those containing flammable materials. The results have shown that the system is able to operate reliably and safely, without the risk of electric sparks that could ignite flammable materials.
The innovation has the potential to revolutionize the way fluid flow is controlled in hazardous environments, providing a safe and sustainable solution for a wide range of industries, including chemical processing, oil and gas production, and environmental remediation. With its reliable and sustainable power source, the photovoltaic valve control system could become a game-changer in the way fluid flow is controlled in hazardous environments.
