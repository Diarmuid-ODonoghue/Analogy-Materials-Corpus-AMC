Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's a new story that is analogous to the given story:
An architect plans the construction of a new skyscraper to house a tech company. According to his first plan, a unique white elevator system is designed to transport employees from the ground floor to the top floor. However, the architect realizes that during heavy winds the elevator may be too unstable and may pose a safety risk to the employees. In order to avoid this mishap, the architect elaborates a second plan. According to this plan, the skyscraper is equipped with four parallel smaller elevator systems, each with a smaller capacity than the unique white elevator system. This way, only small amounts of people can use each elevator at a time, and the risk of instability during heavy winds is significantly reduced. To implement the second plan, 12 maintenance workers have to work 8 hours daily for 23 days. Each maintenance worker is paid $8 for each hour of work. The total labor of the second plan is cheaper, equal, or more expensive than the labor of the first plan?
