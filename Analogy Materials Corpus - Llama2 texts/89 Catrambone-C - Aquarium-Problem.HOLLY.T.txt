 As the professional aquarium designer was facing the problem of lighting the Titanic replica in the deep-water environment of the aquarium display, I would suggest using bioluminescent organisms to light the display. Bioluminescent organisms are living creatures that produce light naturally, and they are found in many deep-water environments, including the Atlantic Ocean where the Titanic is located. By incorporating bioluminescent organisms into the tank, the designer could create a more realistic and immersive environment for visitors. For example, she could add bioluminescent jellyfish, which would emit a soft, blue-green light, or bioluminescent bacteria, which would emit a red or green light. These organisms would not only provide adequate lighting for the display, but they would also add a touch of realism and beauty to the tank. Furthermore, bioluminescent organisms are adapted to living in low-light environments, so they would thrive in the dark conditions of the tank. This would eliminate the need for artificial lighting, which could disrupt the feeding habits of the fish or raise the temperature of the water. In conclusion, using bioluminescent organisms to light the Titanic replica in the aquarium display would be a creative and effective solution that would enhance the realism and beauty of the display while also providing a more natural and immersive environment for visitors.
