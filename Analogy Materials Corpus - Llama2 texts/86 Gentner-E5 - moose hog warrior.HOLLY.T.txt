 There once was a very possessive cat who was friends with a rabbit. The cat often said to the rabbit, "Don't ever play with anyone else but me." One day the cat went away on a trip and the rabbit had no one to play with. But then a bird came to visit the rabbit. He brought a toy mouse along and said, "Would you like to play with me and my toy mouse?". The rabbit said "Yes." The bird and the rabbit had a great time playing together with the toy mouse. When the cat come back and found the rabbit playing with someone else he got very angry. He shouted, "I'll never play with you again!" The cat was so angry that he jumped into the bird's nest. But the nest began to sway in the wind. The cat was very scared. The bird jumped up and chased after the cat so the cat wouldn't fall out of the nest. The bird stopped the cat from falling and saved the cat's life. In the end, the cat realized that being possessive only got him into trouble. It is better to have two friends instead of one.
