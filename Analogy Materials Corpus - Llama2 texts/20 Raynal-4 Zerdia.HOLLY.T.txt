 Once there was a dolphin named Delphi who donated a few of her dorsal fins to a fisherman so he would promise never to harm dolphins. One day Delphi was swimming in the ocean when she saw the fisherman coming with a net. Delphi swam closer to meet the man, but he attacked and caught her with a single hook. As she struggled to break free, Delphi realized that the hook had one of her own dorsal fins on it. In this new story, Delphi is a dolphin who donates her dorsal fins to the fisherman in exchange for his promise to never harm dolphins. Just like Zerdia in the original story, Delphi is killed by the fisherman when she tries to meet him in peace. The twist in this new story is that the fisherman uses one of Delphi's own dorsal fins to catch her, highlighting the irony of the situation and the betrayal of the fisherman's promise.
