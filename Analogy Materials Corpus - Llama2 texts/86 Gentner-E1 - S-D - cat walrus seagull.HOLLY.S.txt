Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's a new story that is analogous to the given story:
There once was a very possessive dog who was friends with a penguin. The dog often said to the penguin, "Don't ever play with anyone else but me." One day the dog went away on a trip and the penguin had no one to play with. But then a polar bear came to visit the penguin. He brought a sled along and said, "Would you like to play with me and my sled?". The penguin said "Yes." The polar bear and the penguin had a great time sliding and gliding on the polar bear's sled. When the dog come back and found the penguin playing with someone else he got very angry. He shouted, "I'll never play with you again!" The dog was so angry that he jumped onto the polar bear's sled. But the sled began to move faster and faster down a steep hill. The dog was very scared. The polar bear jumped up and chased after the sled so the dog wouldn't crash. The polar bear stopped the runaway sled and saved the dog's life. In the end, the dog realized that being possessive only got him into trouble. It is better to have two friends instead of one.
