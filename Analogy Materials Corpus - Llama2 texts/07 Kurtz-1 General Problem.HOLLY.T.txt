 A small planet was ruled from a powerful space station by a tyrannical leader. The space station was situated in the middle of the planet, surrounded by colonies and spaceports. Many hyperspace routes led to the space station, ready to launch a full-scale attack. However, the rebel leader discovered that the leader had planted traps on each of the hyperspace routes. The traps were set so that small ships could pass through them safely, since the leader needed to move his own troops and supplies to and from the space station. However, any large fleet would trigger the traps, causing a massive explosion that would destroy entire colonies and spaceports. It seemed impossible to capture the space station. In this new story, the planet is replaced by a small country, the fortress is replaced by a powerful space station, and the dictator is replaced by a tyrannical leader. The roads are replaced by hyperspace routes, and the mines are replaced by traps. The rebel general is faced with the same dilemma as the original story - how to capture the space station without causing harm to the surrounding colonies and spaceports.
