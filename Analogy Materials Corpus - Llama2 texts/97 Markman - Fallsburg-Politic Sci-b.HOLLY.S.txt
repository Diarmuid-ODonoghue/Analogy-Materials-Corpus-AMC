Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's a new story that is analogous to the given story:
The English department at a large university has a diverse range of faculty with different areas of expertise. About half of the professors specialize in the study of contemporary literature, with a particular focus on the works of marginalized voices such as women, people of color, and LGBTQ+ individuals. The other half of the faculty are more interested in the study of classical literature, with a focus on the works of authors such as Shakespeare, Austen, and Dickens. Despite their different areas of focus, the faculty members are united in their commitment to promoting critical thinking and creative expression. Recently, the department organized a conference where both groups presented their findings, and the event was well-attended and received positively by the academic community. The faculty members are also actively involved in mentoring students and have secured numerous research grants from government agencies and private foundations, which have allowed them to hire research assistants to support their work.
