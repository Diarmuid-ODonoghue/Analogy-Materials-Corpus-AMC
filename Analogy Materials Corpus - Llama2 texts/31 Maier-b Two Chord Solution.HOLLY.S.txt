Great! Here's a new story that is analogous to the given story:
You find yourself stranded on a deserted island with limited resources. You have two coconuts that you must find a way to connect to each other without using any tools or equipment. The coconuts are placed on opposite sides of a small stream, and you must figure out how to cross the stream without using any bridges or boats. Some objects are placed around the island, such as rocks, vines, and driftwood, that could be used to help you solve the puzzle. Can you come up with a creative solution to connect the two coconuts?
