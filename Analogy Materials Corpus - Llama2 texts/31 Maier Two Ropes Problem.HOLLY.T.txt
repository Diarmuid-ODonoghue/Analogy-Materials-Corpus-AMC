 In a vast landscape, two trees stand alone, separated by a wide distance. One tree has a small hollow in its trunk, while the other has a small hook protruding from its branch. A traveler finds themselves stranded between the two trees, with the task of connecting them. However, the problem is that the trees are too far apart for the traveler to reach both trees at once, and there is no obvious way to bridge the gap. Can you think of a way for the traveler to connect the two trees?
