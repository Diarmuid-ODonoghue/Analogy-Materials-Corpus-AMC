 A wise old owl named Hoot lived in a hollow tree at the edge of a dense forest. One sunny morning, a young boy with a net and a bucket appeared at the edge of the forest, searching for birds to catch. Hoot watched from her perch as the boy scanned the trees, looking for his next catch. Hoot knew the boy wanted to add her to his collection, so she flew down to him and offered to give him a few of her feathers in exchange for his promise to never harm her or any of her feathered friends again. The boy was amazed by Hoot's generosity and gratefully accepted her offer. From that day on, he left the forest and its inhabitants in peace.
