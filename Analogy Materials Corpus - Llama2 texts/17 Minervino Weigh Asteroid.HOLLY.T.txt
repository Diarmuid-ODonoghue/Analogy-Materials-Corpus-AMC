 A group of archaeologists were exploring a remote desert region, on their way to an excavation site, when they stumbled upon a massive, ancient structure. None of them could believe their eyes, but they were sure that this structure was built by an advanced civilization thousands of years ago. To learn more about the structure, the team needed to measure its size and complexity. The tape measure that they had allowed them to measure the structure's height and length. However, the tools that they had brought could only reveal the structure's surface details. They looked around in a nearby oasis to see what resources they had to uncover the structure's secrets. How could they solve the problem?
