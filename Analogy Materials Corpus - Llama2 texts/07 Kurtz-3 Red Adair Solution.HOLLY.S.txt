Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's a new story that is analogous to the given story:
A massive wildfire broke out in the Amazon rainforest, consuming an enormous amount of vegetation and land each day. After initial efforts to contain it failed, renowned firefighter Jane Smith was called in. Jane knew that the fire could be put out if a huge amount of water could be dropped on the base of the fire. However, there was no hose large enough to put all the water on the fire fast enough. The small hoses that were available could not shoot the water quickly enough to do any good. It looked like there would have to be a costly delay before a serious attempt could be made. How can the fire be put out immediately?
Jane Smith knew just what to do. She stationed her team of firefighters in a circle around the fire, with all of the available small hoses. When everyone was ready, all the hoses were opened up and the water was directed at the fire from all directions. In this way, a huge amount of water quickly struck the source of the fire. The blaze was extinguished, and the government was satisfied that Jane had earned her three-million-dollar fee.
