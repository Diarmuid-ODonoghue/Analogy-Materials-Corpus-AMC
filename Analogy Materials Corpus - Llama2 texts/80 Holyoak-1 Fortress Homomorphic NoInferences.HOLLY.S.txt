Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's a new story that is analogous to the given story:
A small planet was under the iron rule of a powerful alien overlord. The overlord's fortress was situated in the center of the planet, surrounded by lush forests and bustling cities. Many hyperspace routes radiated outward from the fortress like spokes on a wheel. A brave rebel leader arose who rallied a large fleet of spacecraft at the edge of the planet and vowed to capture the fortress and free the planet of the overlord. The rebel leader knew that if his entire fleet could attack the fortress at once, it could be captured. His ships were poised at the edge of one of the hyperspace routes leading to the fortress, ready to jump in and attack. However, a spy from the overlord's forces brought the rebel leader a disturbing report. The ruthless overlord had planted traps on each of the hyperspace routes. The traps were set so that small ships could pass through them safely, since the overlord needed to be able to move troops and supplies to and from the fortress. However, any large fleet would detonate the traps. Not only would this destroy the hyperspace route and render it impassable, but the overlord would then destroy entire systems in retaliation. A full-scale direct attack on the fortress therefore appeared impossible.
