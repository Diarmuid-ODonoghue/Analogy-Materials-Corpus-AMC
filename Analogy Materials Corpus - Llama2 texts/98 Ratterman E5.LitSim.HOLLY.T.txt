 Maria was a young woman from Brazil who was vacationing in Australia. She was determined to impress her friends and family back home with her golden tan. So one day, Maria spent the whole day lounging by the pool, soaking up the sun's rays. She didn't realize how dangerous it could be to stay in the sun for so long without proper protection. By the end of the day, Maria had a severe sunburn and was in agony. She decided that Australia was not her cup of tea and flew back to Brazil. In this new story, Maria is from Brazil instead of Sweden, and Australia is the location instead of Hawaii. However, the plot is similar - a young person wants to impress others with their tan and ends up getting a severe sunburn as a result.
