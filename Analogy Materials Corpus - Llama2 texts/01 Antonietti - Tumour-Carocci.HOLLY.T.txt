 In a similar story, there is a group of astronauts on a mission to explore a distant planet. One of the astronauts, John, suddenly falls ill and is unable to continue with the mission. However, the planet's atmosphere is too toxic for them to return to the spacecraft, and they are stranded on the hostile surface. The other astronauts, Sarah, Tom, and Lisa, must find a way to rescue their teammate before he succumbs to the poisonous air. They have the necessary equipment, including oxygen tanks and a communication device, but they are far from any safe location. They realize that if they extend a tether from the spacecraft to John's location, they can create a makeshift elevator to transport him to safety. However, they must carefully calculate the length and tension of the tether to ensure John is lifted safely and doesn't plummet to his death. Through teamwork and ingenuity, they are able to rescue their comrade without endangering themselves or anyone else.
