Title: Innovative Water Conservation System for Residential Use
Abstract: Embodiments of the present invention provide a water conservation system for residential use, which includes a gray water interface valve system and a vacuum source. The system collects and stores gray water from sinks, showers, and washing machines, and utilizes a vacuum source to evacuate the water from the collection tank. The system includes a basin for collecting gray water, a reservoir in fluid communication with the outlet, a vent line associated with the reservoir, a pressure switch associated with the reservoir, a controller associated with the pressure switch, a solenoid valve activated by the controller, and a drain valve adapted to open via vacuum pressure and evacuate gray water from the reservoir. The system is designed to reduce water waste and conserve water resources, while also providing a cost-effective and efficient solution for residential water conservation.
Background of the Invention: With the increasing awareness of water conservation and the need to reduce water waste, there is a growing demand for innovative solutions that can help conserve water resources. Traditional water conservation methods, such as installing low-flow fixtures and using drought-resistant plants, are often insufficient to meet the water conservation needs of residential areas. The present invention provides a novel solution that utilizes a gray water interface valve system and a vacuum source to collect and store gray water, and evacuate it from the collection tank.
