 Two small islands, Nova and Coral, were located in the heart of the Pacific Ocean. Both islands relied heavily on the fishing industry to sustain their economies. They competed with each other over which one of them would catch the most valuable and exotic fish species. Meanwhile, a larger island, Triton, had a thriving fishing industry with advanced technology and infrastructure. Triton's fishing fleet was the most modern and efficient in the region, and its fish markets were always bustling with buyers from all over the world. Because of this, Nova tried to form an alliance with Triton to improve its own fishing industry and compete with Coral. However, a devastating typhoon hit the islands, causing widespread destruction and bankrupting all three islands. In this new story, the two small islands (Nova and Coral) are replaced by two weak nations (Lincoln and Moreland), and the larger island (Chad) is replaced by another nearby nation (Triton) with a strong economy and advanced technology. The competition over tourism is replaced by a competition over fishing, which is a significant industry in many tropical regions. The twist at the end, where the islands are hit by a devastating typhoon, adds a sense of urgency and highlights the vulnerability of these small nations to natural disasters.
