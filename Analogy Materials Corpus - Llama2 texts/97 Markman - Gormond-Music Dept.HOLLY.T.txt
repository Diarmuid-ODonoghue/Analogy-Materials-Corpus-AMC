 The art department at Willowdale University was established in 2010 in response to student demand for more creative expression and visual arts courses. Like the music department at Gordmont, the art department was formed in response to student pressure for more undergraduate education opportunities. The University hired the most talented and experienced instructors in the field to teach courses in drawing, painting, sculpture, and graphic design. Despite the department's relatively recent establishment, the faculty have been recognized with the prestigious University Teaching Award for the past three years. However, due to budget constraints, the department has not been able to hire as many faculty members as originally planned, making it the smallest department on campus. Here are some similarities and differences between the two stories: Similarities: * Both departments were established in response to student pressure for more undergraduate education opportunities. * Both departments have received recognition for the quality of their faculty, with the University Teaching Award being awarded to faculty in both departments for the past three years. Differences: * The music department at Gordmont was established in 1987, while the art department at Willowdale University was established in 2010. * The music department is larger than the art department, with more faculty members and a wider range of courses offered. * The art department has faced budget constraints, which has limited the number of faculty members it has been able to hire, making it the smallest department on campus.
