 Maria was a woman who lived with her husband in their cozy home. She was known for her delicious cooking, and her husband, Carlos, often boasted to their friends about how well he ate. One day, when Maria was feeling particularly hungry, she realized that she had only prepared enough food for herself and their young daughter. Seeing that Carlos was not coming home for dinner, she assumed he must be dining out with his friends. However, Carlos had actually forgotten to eat and arrived home late, only to find that there was no food left for him. Determined to avoid going hungry again, Maria decided to marry a second husband, hoping that he would be able to provide for her and their family. In this new story, Maria's decision to marry a second husband is a result of her desire to ensure that she and her family are well-fed, just as Alexander's decision to marry a second wife in the original story was a result of his desire to always eat well. The analogy between the two stories lies in the fact that both Maria and Alexander are motivated by a desire to provide for their loved ones, and both stories explore the consequences of their actions.
