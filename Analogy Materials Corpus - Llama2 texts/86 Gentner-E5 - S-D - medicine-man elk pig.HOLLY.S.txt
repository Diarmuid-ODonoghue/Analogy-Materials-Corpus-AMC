Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's a new story that is analogous to the given story:
There once was a very possessive dragon who was friends with a unicorn. The dragon often said to the unicorn, "Don't ever play with anyone else but me." One day the dragon went on a quest and the unicorn had no one to play with. But then a mermaid came to visit the unicorn. She brought a treasure chest along and said, "Would you like to play with me and my treasure chest?". The unicorn said "Yes." The mermaid and the unicorn had a great time playing with the treasure chest together. When the dragon returned and found the unicorn playing with someone else he got very angry. He shouted, "I'll never play with you again!" The dragon was so angry that he breathed fire at the mermaid. But the mermaid was quick and dodged the fire. She then used her magic to put out the fire and save the unicorn's life. In the end, the dragon realized that being possessive only got him into trouble. It is better to have two friends instead of one.
