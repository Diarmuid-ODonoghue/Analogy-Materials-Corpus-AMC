 Bella the bear had the most beautiful garden in the entire forest. She believed that her talent for gardening was so great that a severe drought would never come to the area she lived in. A neighboring squirrel, Benny, kept telling Bella that her irrigation system was faulty and would never be able to withstand the dry spell. However, Bella was confident in her abilities and tried to convince Benny that nothing was wrong with her garden. One day, a severe drought hit the forest, and Bella panicked and realized that Benny was right. Bella went off and got all the materials she would need to fix her irrigation system. By the time she was ready to start, the sun was shining brightly, and Bella couldn't work anymore. Bella's garden was dry and withered, and the inside of her house was ruined.
