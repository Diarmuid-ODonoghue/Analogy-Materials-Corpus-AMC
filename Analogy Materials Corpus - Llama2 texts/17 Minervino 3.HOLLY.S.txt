Of course! Here's a new story that is analogous to the given story:
There was a stain on a white shirt that could be removed by a special cleaning solution, but the solution was so powerful that it would also bleach the entire shirt. The problem was that the stain was located in a delicate area, and the owner of the shirt didn't want to risk damaging the fabric.
In this new story, the stain is replaced by the ink spot in the trouser, and the special cleaning solution is replaced by a solution of chlorine. The problem is the same - the solution is so powerful that it will also bleach the area surrounding the spot, which could damage the fabric. The delicate area in this story is the white shirt, which represents the trouser in the original story.
