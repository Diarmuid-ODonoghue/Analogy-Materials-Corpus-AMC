 Luna the lynx spent the entire summer purring and meowing. When autumn arrived, Luna visited a rabbit and purred a song for her, hoping to receive some of the rabbit's juicy carrots in return. However, the rabbit was very disappointed in her. "You are a terrible meower!" she exclaimed. "I'm not giving you any of my carrots." A tear rolled down Luna's cheek, and she vowed to give up meowing for good.
